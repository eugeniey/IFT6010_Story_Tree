It didn't scare me enough then,\" Skywalker says as shots of Rey using the Force are shown. \"It does now.\"\n\nThe trailer also includes shots of battles taking place on new planets and in space, and ends with the evil Ren seemingly reaching out his hand to Rey.\n\n\"I need someone to show me my place in all this,\" Rey says as the trailer closes.\n\nThe trailer garnered a big reaction on social media and racked up more than 300,000 views on YouTube in roughly 30 minutes.\n\nTickets to \"Last Jedi\" went on sale following the trailer's debut, leaving fans scrambling to nab a ticket to the film -- which opens on December 15.\n\nBefore the trailer's premiere, Disney released a new poster for the film. The print had a red hue and included characters like Rey wielding a blue lightsaber as well as a bearded Skywalker shrouded in a black hood in the center.\n\nCheck out the brand new poster for Star Wars: #TheLastJedi and watch the trailer tonight. pic.twitter.com/A4UGpYqoeW — Star Wars (@starwars) October 10, 2017\n\n\"Last Jedi\" is the eighth episode in the \"Star Wars\" saga and is a direct sequel to the 2015 blockbuster, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\"\n\nIt stars Ridley, John Boyega and Hamill. It is also the last film role of Fisher, who died last year.\n\nDisney acquired Lucasfilm and the \"Star Wars\" franchise from creator George Lucas in 2012 for $4 billion.\n\nThe company has already seen a windfall at the box office with \"Force Awakens\" bringing in more than $2 billion worldwide and \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,\" the franchise's first spinoff, which made more than $1 billion.",

It didn't scare me enough then,\" Skywalker says as shots of Rey using the Force are shown. \"It does now.\"\n\nThe trailer also includes shots of battles taking place on new planets and in space, and ends with the evil Ren seemingly reaching out his hand to Rey.\n\n\"I need someone to show me my place in all this,\" Rey says as the trailer closes.\n\nThe trailer garnered a big reaction on social media and racked up more than 300,000 views on YouTube in roughly 30 minutes.\n\nTickets to \"Last Jedi\" went on sale following the trailer's debut, leaving fans scrambling to nab a ticket to the film -- which opens on December 15.\n\nBefore the trailer's premiere, Disney released a new poster for the film. The print had a red hue and included characters like Rey wielding a blue lightsaber as well as a bearded Skywalker shrouded in a black hood in the center.\n\nCheck out the brand new poster for Star Wars: #TheLastJedi and watch the trailer tonight. pic.twitter.com/A4UGpYqoeW — Star Wars (@starwars) October 10, 2017\n\n\"Last Jedi\" is the eighth episode in the \"Star Wars\" saga and is a direct sequel to the 2015 blockbuster, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\"\n\nIt stars Ridley, John Boyega and Hamill. It is also the last film role of Fisher, who died last year.\n\nDisney acquired Lucasfilm and the \"Star Wars\" franchise from creator George Lucas in 2012 for $4 billion.\n\nThe company has already seen a windfall at the box office with \"Force Awakens\" bringing in more than $2 billion worldwide and \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,\" the franchise's first spinoff, which made more than $1 billion.",

                  "TEXT": "Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book \" Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success \" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) Finally lumbering into a devastated Puerto Rico aboard Air Force One, almost two weeks after Hurricane Maria made landfall, President Trump came face-to-face with the kind of reality he can't deflect with anger and derision. A world waited to see if in a crisis, an unscripted Trump would rise to the occasion. He did not.\n\nUpon arriving, Trump sat with a group of government officials and began praising his own administration. Like Snow White's evil stepmother who demanded the mirror remind her that she is \"the fairest of them all,\" he then asked Rep. Jenniffer González-Colón to join in the fawning and flattering.\n\n\"I watched the other day,\" said the TV-addicted President, \"and she was saying such nice things about all of the people who have worked so hard. Jenniffer, do you think you can say a little bit of what you said about us today?\" He quickly added, \"It's not about me,\" but of course it was.\n\nAs everyone knows, the only way to deal with the President is with praise, indulgence and political pats on the head. Thus it was that González-Colón and all those who spoke to the President gave him the verbal thumbs-up even as the 3.5 million people of Puerto Rico entered their third week of suffering as many still lacked electricity, secure supplies of food and reliable clean water.\n\nIndeed, the only real complaint came from Trump himself, who said, \"I hate to tell you Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack.\"\n\nA narcissist's tour de force, Trump's arrival meeting was likely the first time any president visited a part of the country ravaged by natural disaster and complained about the cost of the emergency response. Something inside him realized he had gone too far. \"That's fine,\" he quickly added, \"We've saved a lot of lives.\"\n\nLifesaving is what the federal government is supposed to do when disaster strikes, and when hurricanes recently ravaged Texas and Florida he wasted no time getting to the scene and never complained about the cost.\n\nIn the case of Puerto Rico, he wasted time on bashing football players protesting racial inequities and took his eye off the island as he enjoyed a long weekend at a golf resort. As the Washington Post reported , for four days \"Trump and his top aides effectively went dark themselves.\"\n\nTrump was so slow to react to the tragedy in Puerto Rico that the mayor of San Juan cried out in frustration. Naturally, the President took personal offense. \"The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,\" the President said in a tweet from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nHe also said, \"Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.\"\n\nThe bizarre comments were just another example of the psycho-political dynamic that makes dealing with this President so difficult. In his world, problems are caused by bad people, especially his personal enemies, and if you don't want him to blame you for causing problems then you had better make it clear that you agree with him.\n\nAs Trump established himself in Washington, his minions were challenged to live in his distortion field. At the start, Sean Spicer showed how it was done as he affirmed the President's wildly inaccurate claims about the enormous crowds at his inauguration.\n\nIn February, adviser Sebastian Gorka said reports of White House chaos were inaccurate, even as stories of disarray poured out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. By June, everyone seemed to have figured out how to make Trump happy. During a bizarre Cabinet meeting, he was praised like a god . Chief of staff Reince Priebus was typical as he said, \"We thank you for the opportunity and blessing to serve your agenda.\"\n\nThough able as toadies, Spicer, Gorka and Priebus would soon be gone from the White House because they, nevertheless, failed as mirrors for the Trump image. This is another problem when it comes to a chief executive with a brittle ego. Though he demands loyalty from others, he is stinting in his own commitments, and woe to the man or woman who makes him look bad.\n\nTake, for example, the administration's other recent debacle, which culminated with Health & Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigning after spending $1 million on private and military jet travel. Trump demanded he go, not because he abused the taxpayers, but because the scandal made him, Donald Trump, look bad. \"Look, I think he's a very fine person,\" Trump said of Price before adding, \"I certainly don't like the optics.\"\n\nDenying the reality everyone else can see, Trump said Price was a \"fine man,\" and not an arrogant bureaucrat, because to say otherwise would suggest that he had made a mistake when selecting him in the first place. Trump is so allergic to even the hint of a mistake, miscalculation or inadequacy that he's rather confess that he was bothered by the way Price made him look than by what he actually did.\n\nThe President's preference for his own reality is not new. Throughout his life, he has used his money, power and temper to construct his own reality. His massive business bankruptcies were not failures but brilliant bits of management. He said he was New York's biggest builder when he wasn't. And, as Adweek pointed out, he declared that his reality TV show \"The Celebrity Apprentice\" was Number 1, even when it was 41st.\n\nHis reality shows, pasted together from days of video-taped interactions, were no more real than the conspiracy Trump once claimed was responsible for the idea that asbestos was a human health hazard. However, it was the ideal expression of the mind of Donald Trump. Everyone on the program competed for his attention, and praised his acumen. On television, as in his offices, there was no percentage in piercing the fantasy.\n\nThe problem for Trump is that some realities cannot be explained away by complaints about \"fake news\" or by his usual methods of blaming and shaming others. In Puerto Rico, he was confronted with the immutable fact of a devastating hurricane. He failed in his initial response, made things worse by lashing out at the locals and mishandled a visit that should have been all about compassion but was instead, all about him.\n\nSadly, the country is also struggling to recover from another massive tragedy in Las Vegas where a gunman killed 59 people and injured hundreds more at a music festival. This crisis was so acute that the President was able to appear on TV, speak the comforting words written for him and not make things worse.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWhen the President arrives in Las Vegas this week on yet another mission that calls for presidential grace, in response to trauma, he will have one more opportunity to show he is more than self-centered, ego-driven and insecure. It's another chance to occupy the same reality that brings such pain to the rest of us. His record leaves great doubt as to whether he's up to it.",

Though the Buddhist site's official name is Risshakuji Temple, it's more commonly referred to as Yamadera by the locals, meaning \"mountain temple.\"\n\nThough its official name is Risshakuji, locals refer to it simply as Yamadera -- which means \"mountain temple.\" The temple complex, founded in AD 860 to oversee the northern Tohoku region's Tendai Buddhism sect, is actually made up of more than a dozen various sites of religious importance, such as shrines, gates and monuments.\n\nThat includes the Konpon-chudo Hall, which is said to house a Buddhist flame that's been burning continuously for more than 1,000 years. The Hiho-kan (treasure hall), built in 1144, is where Yamadera's most precious Buddhist artifacts are held.\n\nTackling the 1,015 steps\n\nClimbing the 1,015-step staircase that winds its way up Mount Hoju-san to the temple's main hall -- Okunoin -- is intended to be a meditative experience.\n\nSomeone obviously didn't tell that to the half a dozen or so packs of middle school students I encountered on the trail during my visit.\n\nMany cried out in exaggerated agony as they gripped the staircase railing, while the athletes of the group charged ahead, stoically looking forward as they took the stairs two at a time. But this was not a race to the top. Camaraderie was on full display. Descending hikers offered nods of encouragement to those of us making the ascent, many saying \"konnichiwa\" as they passed.\n\nSympathetic gazes were cast upon a sweat-drenched father making the climb while carrying his toddler daughter, who sat in a carrier on his back. Fortunately, stopping is encouraged.\n\nWhether it's a stone sculpture in front of a cliff wall that's embedded with thousands of one-yen coins or a burst of fiery red leaves hanging just perfectly over a shrine, there are plenty of plausible excuses to pause and catch your breath. And when you finally do reach the summit, the payoff is instant. Interestingly it's not the Okunoin main hall that's the biggest draw.\n\nBefore you even reach Okunoin you'll pass what are likely the two most photographed buildings at Yamadera: Kaisando Hall and the small red Nokyodo building, which tower over the valley below.\n\nA nearby path takes visitors to the wooden observation platform, Godaido, which gives incredible views of the surrounding Yamagata countryside.\n\nGetting there\n\nYamadera Station is about a 40-minute train ride from Tohoku's biggest city, Sendai, in neighboring Miyagi prefecture.\n\nFor those traveling from Tokyo, the Shinkansen train from Tokyo Station to Yamagata Station takes just over 2.5 hours. Yamadera Station is a 20-minute train ride from there. The temple's entrance is about a 10-minute walk from the station. Multiple signs direct the way.",

A fight between The New York Times and Slate inspired us to try and figure that out.\n\nThis article is from the archive of our partner . We can all agree that Millennials are the worst. But what is a Millennial? A fight between The New York Times and Slate inspired us to try and figure that out. After the Times ran a column giving employers tips on how to deal with Millennials (for example, they need regular naps) (I didn't read the article; that's from my experience), Slate's Amanda Hess pointed out that the examples the Times used to demonstrate their points weren't actually Millennials. Some of the people quoted in the article were as old as 37, which was considered elderly only 5,000 short years ago. The age of employees of The Wire, the humble website you are currently reading, varies widely, meaning that we too have in the past wondered where the boundaries for the various generations were drawn. Is a 37-year-old who gets text-message condolences from her friends a Millennial by virtue of her behavior? Or is she some other generation, because she was born super long ago? (Sorry, 37-year-old Rebecca Soffer who is a friend of a friend of mine and who I met once! You're not actually that old!) Since The Wire is committed to Broadening Human Understanding™, I decided to find out where generational boundaries are drawn.\n\nI started by calling the Census Bureau. A representative called me back, without much information. \"We do not define the different generations,\" she told me. \"The only generation we do define is Baby Boomers and that year bracket is from 1946 to 1964.\" Next, I spoke with Tom DiPrete, a sociology professor at Columbia University. And he agreed with the Census Bureau. \"I think the boundaries end up getting drawn to some extent by the media,\" DiPrete said, \"and the extent to which people accept them or not varies by the generation.\" DiPrete explained that there was a good sociological reason for identifying the Baby Boom as a discrete generation. It \"had specific characteristics,\" and occurred within an observable timeframe. World War II ended. You had the post-war rise in standard of living and the rise of the nuclear family. Then societal changes disrupted those patterns, and the generation, for academic purposes, was over. His main point: \"History isn't always so punctuated.\" I understood why Generation X, a generation defined by turmoil and uncertainty, would be poorly defined. But what about Millennials? Doesn't their shared experience of the millennium transition and technology provide similar markers? \"I actually haven't seen efforts to document [generations] rigorously, and I would be somewhat skeptical that they can be documented rigorously.\" DiPrete said. The things that have shaped Millennials — the rise of technology and social networks, for example — \"affect people's lives differently.\"",

                  "TEXT": "At least it wasn't a text, like the hasty, solitary line that exploded K.S. Narendran's world almost three years ago: \"We deeply regret that we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those on board survived.\"\n\nHis wife of 25 years, Chandrika Sharma, was one of the 239 people aboard the Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing on March 8, 2014.\n\nOn Tuesday, Narendran learned the search for the missing plane had been suspended. He saw the email a little before noon at his home in the southeastern Indian city of Chennai.\n\n\"An email is an improvement over an SMS message,\" he posted on Facebook. \"So, small mercies in an otherwise difficult period.\"\n\nK.S. Narendran is no closer to knowing what happened to his wife, a passenger on MH370.\n\nThen came the media requests for interviews. India Today, BBC, The Guardian, Deutsche Welle, NPR. He had become a spokesman for the MH370 families. After a group statement on the search suspension was made public, every journalist wanted to know Narendran's reaction.\n\nHe expressed deep disappointment that the search was over. Anger that the governments of Malaysia, China and Australia had not followed a recent recommendation to search another 25,000 square kilometers north of the last search area. And betrayal: Those governments, he said, had made a commitment to the families of the lost passengers, and now they were reneging.\n\nJUST WATCHED The search for MH370 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The search for MH370 01:11\n\n\"I sensed my faith in the search and investigation erode precipitously, indeed faith in the entire gamut of institutional arrangements in place globally to keep us safe and secure, reassured that the journeys we undertake will indeed take us to our chosen destinations,\" he wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"MH370 didn't make it to Beijing. And we may never know why it didn't. We can never be sure that there will not be another tragedy.\"\n\nThe day seemed not to end. A flurry of emotions led to many moments of futility. Suspending the search was in part a message that the world was asking him to move on. As though he could.\n\nThe next morning, he boarded a plane for a business trip to Mumbai on India's west coast. After MH370, Narendran developed a dread for planes. Sometimes in his seat, he role-plays and goes to a dark place. What was the experience like for his wife?\n\nNarendran met his wife in college and the two were married for 25 years.\n\nThe question consumes him to the point where he, an articulate man with considerable language skills, finds himself at a loss for words. He has to virtually kick himself out of that state and force himself to sleep. It's his only way out.\n\n\"I don't even wait for the plane's doors to close,\" he tells me. \"I just try to sleep.\"\n\nI first spoke with Narendran a few days after MH370 vanished from the skies. I reached out to him after a mutual friend showed me his Facebook posts, and we have been in touch ever since.\n\nThis time, we talk two days after he learned of the decision to stop the search. I want to ask him many things, but first he analyzes the mystery of the missing plane. He doesn't understand why the search was called off when debris -- confirmed to be from MH370 -- had been found off the coast of southern Africa.\n\n\"Common sense would suggest they would be hurrying to go and look there,\" he says. \"It is really puzzling. I have wracked my brain all this time on why then have been such a laggard on this front.\"\n\nThat leaves him wondering whether there is truth to conspiracy theories that suggest a cover-up.\n\n\"Maybe they know more than what was said and they want a closure to this investigation,\" he says.\n\nI can hear the frustration in his voice. I can hear the exhaustion.\n\nI ask him about a difficult question a radio interviewer posed the day before: \"Have you been able to have any kind of ceremony for her -- funeral?\"\n\nHe attempted to answer: \"We have had no ceremony. It's hard to think of one when you don't know ... when was the end? Where was the end?\"\n\nNarendran and I have discussed this several times in our many conversations via phone, Skype, email and even in person at a Bangalore coffee house. He said in the past that his family and friends suggested some sort of memorial to help him let go, move forward, bring closure and all those clichéd things we say after loss.\n\nThe truth is he doesn't take kindly to rituals and besides, he wouldn't even know how to begin planning such a ceremony. It would drain his energy, he tells me. And for what?\n\nHow do you say goodbye to the person you loved most -- without knowing?\n\nIn the summer of 2015, he initiated the process of obtaining a death certificate for Chandrika. The pragmatic part of him said it was needed to settle insurance policies, bank accounts, property matters and other assets his wife held.\n\nAll he really had was a message from Malaysia Airlines confirming Chandrika was a passenger on the missing plane. A death certificate would provide documentation.\n\nBut it has to be issued by a court in Kuala Lumpur, and he is still waiting. One of his unsavory chores is to keep writing to ask about the status, and it adds to a host of other reminders.\n\nThey include the daily walks he used to take with Chandrika. After she was gone, he often imagined conversations with the woman he met in college and had shared life's joys and disappointments with.\n\nWhere have you been, Chandrika?\n\nOh, many places. All at the same time. Can you believe that?\n\nWhen will you be back?\n\nYour guess is as good as mine.\n\nFor good. That is.\n\nWhat if I am gone for good?\n\nHe fantasized about new facts being unearthed that might provide incontrovertible evidence. Then he could say: Case closed, like the ending of a Sherlock Holmes story. Time to move on.\n\nBut those facts never came, and for almost three years now, Narendran has lived life with crushing uncertainty. There were days that were more jarring than others: when the missing plane was in the news, when debris was found, when the first anniversary came and then the second. And now, the end of the search.\n\nBut to him, day 364 was the same as day 365. It was another day without her.\n\nI sense that perhaps Narendran has begun to move on, however slow the progress. I ask him if he still speaks with his wife.\n\n\"My conversations lately have been with myself,\" he says. \"What I wish to do with my life. And I don't think I have answers yet.\"\n\nNor has the uncertainty abated as much as he would have liked.\n\nOne reason, he surmises, is his role as spokesman for Voice 370, the support group for families of the missing.\n\n\"That role travels with me 24 hours a day,\" he says. \"It has a way of keeping alive the questions and continues the agonizing. I think the questions about finding answers, finding an explanation that is credible enough, sufficiently substantiated, remains very important.\n\n\"Why? I have often asked myself the same question. And I don't think I have a very clear answer. The sense of incredulity about all that's happened doesn't just go away. That something like this should ever have happened where there is neither a trace nor understanding or explanation of how this might have happened is very deeply disturbing.\"\n\nPhotos: Remembering the passengers of MH370 There is still no way to know for sure why Flight MH370 ended, but we are learning more about the lives of those on board.

Hide Caption 12 of 12\n\nThen there all the relatives and friends who constantly ask him questions or want an update. \"Tell me what is happening,\" they say.\n\n\"There is always this underlying assumption that the families know something more than the rest of the world. And we don't,\" he says.\n\nSo it remains unfinished business.\n\n\"I also frankly believe there are larger questions of fairness, justice, accountability that can't be so easily put away,\" he says. \"There are levels of agitation and I tell myself: I can't just let this pass. I can't get on with life. I have not flushed my system of MH370.\"\n\nThese are the sorts of things Narendran is often not asked about in the myriad interviews he gives. How do you even begin in a 5-minute radio or TV segment? But I have learned about him over the course of our acquaintance.\n\nFrom the beginning, I felt his strength in the quietness of his voice and the power of his words. He is someone who doesn't always emote outwardly -- I've never heard him cry, although on several occasions he has brought tears to my eyes.\n\nHe tells me that writing about MH370 and his life without Chandrika has helped him enormously. It has forced him to learn about himself.\n\nPeople who suffer great pain or sorrow often find refuge in prayer and hope. Many of the families of MH370 held onto the hope that everyone on that plane was still alive. That included some of Narendan's relatives.\n\nBut Narendran was not one of them. He found comfort in his writing. It helps him gain insight on how he has been dealing with life after tragedy.\n\nThe eye cannot see itself, he tells me, quoting Shakespeare. \"I need to hear from others on how they see me and then reflect back on what resonates with me.\"\n\nWe end our conversation there. What I don't tell him is that I can see he has already done a lot of reflection; that he's already come a long way in his recovery. The search for the missing plane may have ended Tuesday, but what continues is Narendran's quest to find himself again.",

She's worried about the fate of thousands of jobs at a Bombardier factory in Northern Ireland.\n\nIt's not just Northern Ireland: The U.K. argues that 22,000 jobs in over 20 U.S. states are also at risk.\n\nBoeing (BA) asked U.S. officials to slap tariffs on Bombardier in April, accusing the company of dumping its C Series passenger jets on the U.S. market at \"absurdly low prices.\"\n\nThe move against Bombardier (BDRAF) could have a serious impact on Northern Ireland, where 4,200 people work at a company facility that makes wings for the C Series.\n\nIt could also hurt May, whose government could collapse if it lost the support of a fringe political party in the region.\n\n\"The U.K. government is working tirelessly to safeguard Bombardier's operations,\" the U.K. government said in a statement. \"Our priority is to encourage Boeing to drop its case and seek a negotiated settlement with Bombardier.\"\n\nThe Times of London first reported the phone call.\n\nBombardier has rejected Boeing's accusations, which include claims that it receives illegal state aid, and described its call for U.S. tariffs an \"unfounded attack on the U.K. aerospace industry.\"\n\nBoeing said it took the action because \"subsidized competition has hurt us now and will continue to hurt us for years to come, and we could not stand by given this clear case of illegal dumping.\"\n\nThe White House and U.S. Department of Commerce also did not respond when asked for comment.\n\nRelated: Delta buys 75 new Bombardier jets\n\nThe phone call is part of a wider lobbying campaign. British business secretary Greg Clark went to Chicago in August to meet Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg.\n\nBritain argues that the dispute would also harm U.S. suppliers. It says that 53% of the C Series aircraft is made by U.S. based companies, supporting those 22,000 jobs.\n\nHe has also spoken to U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross about Bombardier on at least two occasions.\n\nBombardier only started delivering C Series jets last year, but already had 360 orders through the end of 2016, including 75 from Delta Air Lines (DAL).",

                  "TEXT": "Barcelona, Spain (CNN) The Catalan government says 90% of voters in the banned independence referendum chose to split from Spain. In the aftermath of the vote, 700,000 people demonstrated against police violence on referendum day. The region is awash in displays of the Catalan flag.\n\nCatalan President Carles Puigdemont has suggested that Catalans are more united than ever , but behind the pictures and the numbers, there is a more nuanced story. The referendum has not only exposed the divisions between Catalonia and Spain, but those within Catalonia itself.\n\nTurnout was only about 43%, meaning that fewer than half of the roughly 5 million Catalans on the electoral roll chose to split from Spain. A few hundred Catalans joined a small rally in Barcelona on Wednesday night to voice their opposition to the separatist movement. Another demonstration is planned for the weekend.\n\nPeople who attended this week's demonstration told CNN they feared the crisis would result in violence on the streets -- and that some who oppose independence are afraid to speak out.\n\n'Send a message of love'\n\nJavi Pacheco does not want Catalan independence and says the debate should be heard in the Spanish Parliament.\n\nJavi Pacheco, who works in advertising and marketing, said he did not believe in independence for the northeastern region.\n\n\"I don't because what is the reason? Spain steals from us? I like Sevillian traditional dance, I like Granada, I love the whole of Andalusia, I like the north of Spain, I love Catalonia, and I love all Spanish people and that is why I think that the independence movement is a manipulation of our feelings which doesn't get us anywhere.\n\n\"It's true that we need to listen to each other, but the debate needs to be in the Spanish Parliament.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Catalonia: What you need to know Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Catalonia: What you need to know 01:10\n\nPacheco said he valued the country's laws and institutions.\n\n\"I am here for people like me who defend Spain and love Catalonia and we think that it is thanks to the constitution that we have been able to live in a totally legal framework,\" he said. \"Being Spanish doesn't mean being a fascist.\"\n\nHe has been saddened to see the events of the past few weeks and the divisions that have arisen between friends and families.\n\n\"It's sad to lose friendships just because you think in a different way. The problem here now is that there seems to be only one point of view and the central government hasn't done much to stop this happening. Sometimes staying silent is reckless, as is trying to give rational solutions to a problem that is emotional.\"\n\nHe believes the rest of Spain should send a \"message of love\" to all Catalans, welcome them to the Spanish Parliament and give them the right to talk.\n\n'This has become a jungle'\n\nSusana Andrés says she is both Catalan and Spanish and doesn't want a fractured society.\n\nSusana Andrés, 45, accused politicians of lying to Catalans and leading them toward a \"war in the streets.\"\n\n\"I am Catalan and Spanish. I do not want to break Catalan society in the way it's happening now. We lived very well, Catalan people all united, and they have turned things into what you can see, what you have seen the last few weeks. Politicians are to blame; we the citizens were living very well,\" she said.\n\n\"I hope that the government will be able to stop all this. This revolution in the streets. I hope the politicians will come to their senses. That they have common sense. Because we were living freely in a democracy and this has become a jungle.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED How Catalonia's independence crisis unfolded Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How Catalonia's independence crisis unfolded 01:49\n\nAndrés, whose family-run graphic-design business closed as a result of Spain's recent economic crisis, said she believes talking is the solution to the crisis. \"Never violence. But talks need to be inside the law,\" she said.\n\nShe said police were just trying to do their job on the day of referendum, when violent clashes left hundreds of people injured as officers tried to prevent the banned vote from going ahead.\n\nAndrés has felt \"very unsafe\" for the past few days, fearing the situation may become violent if people come out into the streets.\n\n\"Everyone [who is against independence] is quiet because they are afraid. They have very strong marketing, the politicians and the regional government, they do it very well,\" she said. \"It's no longer politicians that are at stake, not the police that is at stake. That is not the matter. What's at stake are the people on the streets.\"\n\n'There will be violence'\n\nCarlos fears disastrous economic repercussions if independence is declared.\n\nCarlos, a 57-year-old business owner who preferred to give only his first name for fear of repercussions, is concerned about the potential economic impact of the referendum.\n\nHis suppliers are from across Spain and Europe and he's worried that with independence, his business accounts could be frozen. \"From an economic point of view it would be a total disaster,\" he said.\n\n\"As a company owner, I and many of my friends who have small or medium-sized companies, are moving their physical and fiscal headquarters outside Catalonia. And not just that, we are also moving our bank accounts elsewhere, just in case.\n\nJUST WATCHED German MEP: Catalonia out of EU if it leaves Spain Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH German MEP: Catalonia out of EU if it leaves Spain 07:05\n\n\"The consequences of Catalonia detaching from Spain are, first of all, we would find ourselves out of the EU... We wouldn't be in, we would be out, even though people in favor of independence want us to believe that Catalonia would stay in and that the European Union is eager for Catalonia to be part of it. But that's not true.\"\n\nCarlos believes the Spanish state -- which has the power to dissolve the Catalan government and call new elections -- should act. \"I feel a brutal divide, I feel that those who are not independentists are singled out. And let's not forget that [those who voted] are 2 million -- Catalonia has 7 million. But they're the loudest. I am not afraid -- but I am very worried.\"\n\n'Catalonia should always be part of Spain'\n\nFlight attendant Amanda Garcia says Catalonia should always be a part of Spain.\n\nAmanda Garcia, a 24-year-old flight attendant, is opposed to independence but thinks a legal, nationwide referendum should be held.\n\n\"I am here to call for the unity of Spain because what is happening is illegal and Catalonia should always be a part of Spain,\" she said.\n\n\"I think they could do it [the referendum] but in a legal way, not the way they did it, by breaking the law left and right, with people voting more than one time, without any kind of order, or consensus... and there has to be a punishment. It's like if you rob a bank, you have to pay the consequences and go to prison.\"",

                  "TEXT": "James A. Gagliano is a CNN law enforcement analyst and a retired FBI supervisory special agent. He also serves as an adjunct assistant professor at St. John's University in Queens, New York. Follow him on Twitter @JamesAGagliano . The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(CNN) Lost in the debate about the NFL National Anthem protests is a serious conversation about the issues driving players to take the knee. A number of African-American athletes have attempted to bring attention to what they perceive as the unequal application of justice in America and cases of police brutality against people of color.\n\nAnd the original intent of the protests -- to begin a national discussion on policing in America -- has become a sad afterthought for many people, although perhaps not for law enforcement officials who feel unfairly attacked or those who feel unfairly victimized by them.\n\nThat said, police must continue to do their jobs and not fall prey to the desire either to make their own statements or \"stand down\" from their sworn duties and obligations.\n\nAnd that is difficult to do. Why? Because the law enforcement profession has been under assault for some time now.\n\nA history of dissent\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Los Angeles was a hotbed of unrest between communities of color and police. Rap artists like N.W.A. and Ice-T released hit songs attacking the police -- \"F*** Tha Police\" and \"Cop Killer,\" reflecting the growing animosity toward the city's police force.\n\nNot surprisingly, the police unions did not take kindly to these songs, and they threatened concert shutdowns and arrests.\n\nWhen Amadou Diallo, an immigrant from Guinea, was shot by New York police who mistook his wallet for a gun in February 1999, Bruce Springsteen wrote and performed a song, \"American Skin,\" that included the lyric \"41 shots,\" a reference to the number of rounds discharged by the police at Diallo. This angered members of the police union who threatened to boycott security at his concerts.\n\nMost recently, when Beyoncé performed her sociopolitical song, \"Formation,\" at Super Bowl 50's halftime show in 2016, many police officials condemned the performance, calling it \"divisive\" and threatened boycotts of her future shows. Her musical performance featured backup dancers dressed in Black Panther attire from the 1960s, while the video for the song made several references to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nIn other words, Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, isn't the first -- and likely won't be the last -- to take issue with law enforcement. And, he, like his many predecessors, certainly has a point. There have been real instances of police brutality. To deny that this doesn't occur or pretend it isn't an important issue facing us is disingenuous.\n\nBut Kaepernick may not be in the best position to lead the resistance. He certainly didn't contribute to bridging the divide by being photographed at a 49ers practice in September 2016 wearing socks with images of cops depicted as pigs . The offensive symbol for police dates back to political protests during the 1960s and still frustrates members of law enforcement today.\n\nAnd that same month Kaepernick announced he would donate $1 million of his own money to different organizations. On June 2, Ian Rapoport of NFL Network tweeted a release from the Colin Kaepernick Foundation that included a breakdown of the first $700,000 of his pledge: $25,000 was earmarked for \"Assata's Daughters,\" an organization honoring the daughters of convicted cop killer Joanne Chesimard (Assata Shakur), who escaped from prison and fled to Cuba, where she currently resides beyond the reach of US extradition efforts. For many in law enforcement, she remains a particularly sore subject.\n\nAnd we must remember that policing itself is a difficult business and not everyone is fit to handle its demands and its perils. Every traffic stop on a lonely stretch of highway and every responding visit related to a domestic violence call carries certain risks. And working in most inner cities in America -- where violent crime is more apt to occur -- can certainly be more dangerous for police than an assignment to the suburbs.\n\nProtest isn't the answer\n\nAs a result of this raging debate, many in law enforcement are frustrated. Some have whispered to me about advocating for a \"walk out\" during sporting events when they are assigned to provide security. I've heard officers ponder the notion of a sudden onset of \"blue flu,\" where many of them suddenly call in \"sick\" at the same time.\n\nBut these are not honorable responses. We're sworn to protect and serve, and that oath -- much like the First Amendment that protects the speech we find the most repugnant -- demands we perform our duties in the service of folks whose speech, actions and protests are counter to our beliefs.\n\nYes, we sacrifice a lot to be law enforcement professionals. Yes, we endure unfair criticisms from less-than-grateful recipients of our protections. But our own \"protests\" -- not doing our jobs -- is not a viable response to the athletes' protests.\n\nI certainly disagree with some of Kaepernick's sentiments. But, I am a former law enforcement professional, and I would still take a bullet for him. That's the highest form of honorable and noble service that we can offer --- going into harm's way for those we're duty bound to protect.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAnd I know the vast majority of my former colleagues feel the same way. The Thin Blue Line is predicated on standing between our citizenry and those who would seek to do them harm -- regardless of color or creed.\n\nSo, those officers and federal agents stationed at professional sports contests should simply continue to do their jobs. They're there to detect potential terrorist threats. They're there to disarm someone who enters with a weapon and whose purpose is to harm Americans. They're there to intervene when a drunken fan menaces a family. And they're there to escort the players and coaches safely from the field of play after a tight contest that might have concluded with some bettor on the wrong side of his parlay.\n\nLeave the social media rants to others. Let's continue to honor our oath and do our jobs.",

                  "TEXT": "(CNN) As President Donald Trump looks to curb the government's enforcement of climate regulations , experts are concerned about how the action might impact public health.\n\n\"The current federal political climate in the United States bodes ill for the future of the world's climate and by extension for the health of people around the world, Americans included,\" said Dr. Mona Sarfaty, director of the program on climate and health at George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication\n\nSarfaty helped prepare a report, released last month by the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health , that mapped how climate change threatens the health of people across the United States and how those threats vary by region.\n\nExtreme temperatures and weather events, poor outdoor air quality, contaminated food and water, mosquito- and tick-borne infections, wildfires and stresses on mental health are the climate-related health risks identified in the report by practicing physicians.\n\n\"There's a gap between the public's understanding of the health implications of climate change and physicians' understanding of the health implications of climate change,\" Sarfaty said. \"Most people are not aware that climate change is a danger to their health, and physicians see that risk.\"\n\nGlobally, about 12.6 million people die each year due to environmental risk factors such as pollution, extreme weather or climate-related disease, according to the World Health Organization\n\nBetween 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause 250,000 additional deaths per year around the world, according to the WHO -- including in the United States.\n\n'An increase in disease anywhere ... can affect us all'\n\n\"I think Americans consider climate change as an 'over there' problem or confined to poor countries,\" said Dr. Jonathan Patz, a professor and director of the Global Health Institute at the University of Wisconson-Madison, who was not involved in the consortium's report.\n\n\"Climate change is already influencing the frequency of heatwaves, flooding events and famines, as well as epidemics of vector- and waterborne diseases,\" he said. \"But in a globalized world, an increase in disease anywhere in the world can affect us all.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Is El Niño helping spread Zika? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Is El Niño helping spread Zika? 02:42\n\nPeople along the East Coast might be at a greater risk of mosquito- and tick-borne infections as the climate becomes hotter and more humid, creating an ideal breeding environment for those disease-carrying insects, according to the report.\n\nMosquitoes can transmit \"dengue fever, Zika and West Nile virus, which has spread across the country and is popping up in outbreaks periodically, recently in Texas and Louisiana,\" Sarfaty said.\n\n\"When increased rainfall leads to flooding, there can be a mixing of stormwater and sewage that leads to bacterial contamination in the water. This has been a problem in recreational lakes in the Midwest,\" Sarfaty said. Bacterial contamination also can impact crops, leading to an increase in food-related infections.\n\n\"Warmer ocean water also makes a difference. Along the coast, there are cases of bacterial contamination in shellfish in the warmer months that have those waters more likely to cause infection when people swim there, especially if they have open cuts in their skin,\" she said. \"There have been some cases off the coast of Florida where people have gotten skin infections.\"\n\nSarfaty added that areas along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, such as in Missouri and Ohio, have experienced increased flooding in recent years, which also has led to a risk of contaminated water and water-related infections.\n\n\"There was an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Wisconsin some years ago that was related to one of these rain events,\" she said.\n\nBoth the East and West coasts of the United States are threatened by extreme summer heat, flooding, storms, drought, poor air quality that can impact breathing, allergies and the mental health problems that come with dealing with those health threats, according to the consortium's report.\n\n\"When people are displaced from their homes because of floods or extreme storms ... this loss of home and separation from family and community leads to mental health impacts that can be reflected in substance abuse, alcoholism, domestic strife or violence, depression or anxiety,\" Sarfaty said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Great Plains and Midwest face a slightly different mix of climate change-related health impacts.\n\nIs climate change making our food less nutritious?\n\nPoor air quality, extreme weather and wildfires threaten the Great Plains, while food- and water-related infections and mosquito- and tick-borne diseases threaten the Midwest, according to the consortium's report.\n\nJUST WATCHED Lyme disease on the move Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lyme disease on the move 03:29\n\n\"You've got Lyme disease spreading west into the Midwestern states, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, certainly spreading further north into Canada and also south into Virginia. ... The tick that carries Lyme disease is now found in many more counties than it was before,\" Sarfaty said.\n\nChanges in climate also have affected some crops and food sources in the Great Plains and Midwest, according to the consortium's report.\n\n\"One of the more recent findings that has been surprising to me is the increasing evidence that a carbon dioxide-enriched atmosphere is actually leading to crops that have lower nutritional value,\" Sarfaty said.\n\n\"So it's impacting the nutritional value of grains. That's something which has been increasingly documented, and of course it's very worrisome because the population depends on the growth of grains as a staple in our diet,\" she said.\n\nThe most widespread climate-related health problem\n\nMost climate scientists agree that humans are causing the planet to warm by polluting the atmosphere with heat-trapping greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels like coal, natural gas and oil at power plants.\n\nJUST WATCHED How deadly is air pollution? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How deadly is air pollution? 01:08\n\nFossil fuel pollutants can generate particulate matter , a complex mixture of tiny particles and liquid droplets in the atmosphere. Once inhaled, these small particles can impact your heart and lungs, with serious health effects.\n\n\"The most widespread health problems that physicians reported to us are lung and heart conditions related to poor air quality,\" Sarfaty said of the consortium's report.\n\n\"This consortium also defines the reduction of fossil fuel combustion as one of the best interventions we can do to immediately improve our health, be it through clearer air quality to promoting physically active commuting in cities,\" he said.\n\nTrump signed an executive order last month to review and possibly eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency's \" Clean Power Plan ,\" which was intended to regulate and cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.\n\nThis atmospheric impact on the climate has worsened allergy symptoms , Sarfaty said.\n\nWhy your allergies may be going haywire\n\n\"Ragweed plants are very widespread on the East Coast and into the Midwest and a very common cause of allergies. Those plants actually have more potent allergen in them when they grow in higher-carbon-dioxide atmospheres,\" Sarfaty said.\n\n\"One of the things that we're beginning to hear is that, 'Oh, we don't have to worry about carbon dioxide, because carbon dioxide is plant food.' Well, it turns out that carbon dioxide is actually causing more virulent allergens,\" she said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Global warming brings on more pollen Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Global warming brings on more pollen 01:39\n\nSarfaty also said allergies and some other climate-related health effects tend to be more widespread than regional.\n\nExtreme heat and wildfires are two that have swept most of the country. From 1999 to 2010, there were more than 7,000 heat-related deaths in the US, an average of about 618 per year , according to the CDC.\n\nJUST WATCHED Could climate change be wildfire cause? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Could climate change be wildfire cause? 01:59\n\nLarge wildfires now burn more than twice the area they did around 1970, according to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions\n\nJust a 1-degree Celsius rise in the planet's average global temperature is expected to produce up to a 400% increase in areas burned by wildfires, according to a 2011 report from the National Research Council 's Committee on Stabilization Targets for Atmospheric Greenhouse Gas Concentrations.\n\nSmoke plumes from wildfires can impact the health of residents 100 miles away, Sarfaty said.\n\n\"They can cause increases to emergency rooms for all kinds of respiratory conditions and for cardiac conditions as well, including heart attacks and episodes of heart failure,\" she said.\n\n\"Air quality worsens with rising heat and/or wildfires; longer, more severe allergy conditions; and injuries related to extreme weather events,\" she said. \"These most common conditions seen by physicians and associated with climate change are becoming so widespread that it's hard to cast them as strictly regional vulnerabilities.\"\n\n'We have the opportunity to address this now'\n\nDr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said that as the climate continues to change, the health of more Americans could be affected.\n\nJUST WATCHED By 2100, humans may not survive in the Middle East Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH By 2100, humans may not survive in the Middle East 01:34\n\n\"The wildfire risk on the West, the infectious disease risks in the Midwest and the East Coast are striking differences,\" Benjamin said.\n\n\"More people will find themselves directly impacted as environmental conditions get worse. We have the opportunity to address this now,\" he said. \"At some point the climate changes become more difficult to reverse and many of the events like floods, severe storms and toxic air become so severe that communities will become uninhabitable.\"\n\nA threat to inhabitability looms over other parts of the world.\n\nAs a result of climate change, scientists predict that areas in the Middle East and North Africa could become uninhabitable in the summers by 2100. This \"may exacerbate humanitarian hardship and contribute to migration,\" according to a study published last year in the journal Climate Change\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nYet as mainstream medical societies are recognizing how much climate change threatens our health, communities can prepare for these health impacts, Patz said, giving a nod to the consortium's report.\n\n\"To be honest, I am not surprised by any content in the report and am extremely encouraged by mainstream medical societies now recognizing how much climate change threatens our health,\" he said. \"What stood out to me is how these medical societies are already prioritizing prevention or mitigation of climate change as a major component to the response from the health-care sector.\"",

But President Donald Trump is mangling the US's ability to do so.\n\nIn such an exchange, each state needs three aspects of its words to do three things.\n\nTheir substance needs to convey exactly what that state means, their register needs to convey how relaxed or how angry it is, and the rank of their speaker needs to show how much authority they carry.\n\nNorth Korea is careful on all three points. It expresses itself in uniquely colorful terms, but it usually uses standard phrases with quite precise meanings and deviates from these phrases only to signal a change in its thinking. The same goes for register.\n\nNear-hysterical opprobrium of the US is routine and changes in the flamboyant language signal shifts in mood. Paradoxically this means that sometimes when North Korea is really angry, its language is almost sober. And it uses a carefully graded system of speakers to indicate how firm its statements are. At the bottom of the scale, remarks by unnamed state media commentators are often just trial balloons. At the top, any remark attributed to Kim Jong Un is scripture, unchangeable and non-negotiable.\n\nRead More",

                  "TEXT": "(CNN) Update: This poll is now closed and the results are in: Readers selected food and meat's impact on climate change as the next topic for CNN's Two° series. Thanks to everyone who voted! Sign up for the Two° newsletter to get updates about that story and this series.\n\nPrevious story below:\n\nEvery story needs a villain -- and climate change is no exception.\n\nKnowing which countries and industries contribute to climate change, and in what proportions, is key to understanding how we can fix this problem and avoid 2 degrees Celsius of warming , which is what policymakers regard as the threshold for \"dangerous\" climate change.\n\nPlus, this story is complicated by the fact that nearly all of us -- certainly those reading this column on a mobile phone or computer -- contribute to climate change in some way.\n\nWe're all partly to blame.\n\nI'm going to be exploring this idea of \"climate villains\" for the next month or so, as part of CNN's Two° series , which looks at that threshold for dangerous warming. That's the point at which some island nations are expected to be submerged , drought risks go up considerably and water availability goes down.\n\nI'd like your help in deciding which bad guys to target.\n\nBelow, you'll find a Facebook poll that lists four of my favorite climate villains, all of which came from your suggestions. Pick the one you find most interesting and I'll go out into the world to report on the winner. The poll closes at 5 p.m. ET on Sunday, August 16.\n\nMEET THE CLIMATE CHANGE VILLAINS -- the people and industries whose actions researchers say are causing global warming.... Posted by CNN on Thursday, August 13, 2015\n\nBefore you vote, though, you should know some of the basics. In talking to people about climate change this year, I've found there is SO MUCH confusion about what's causing warming and why.\n\nI've met people -- smart people, reasonable people -- who think that climate change is caused by aerosols from hairspray (it isn't) or that it's just part of a natural warming cycle (it's not). Burning fossil fuels for electricity and heat, as well as chopping down rainforests, contributes to climate change.\n\nHere's a breakdown of global greenhouse gas emissions by sector, according to 2012 data synthesized by the World Resources Institute. This is kind of a \"blame\" chart.\n\nYou also identified more nebulous bad guys, like apathy, greed, ignorance and consumerism. Geography found its way into the mix, too. China, America and the \"3rd world\" all made your list.\n\nSome countries are more to blame than others, sure. But it turns out that the most industrialized countries -- the United States, European countries and, increasingly, China and India -- are among the biggest contributors to climate change, because they burn the most fossil fuels.\n\nHere's a list of the top 10 countries in terms of their overall contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions. This list is measured from 1850, the start of the Industrial Revolution, to 2012, and it's based on data synthesized by the World Resources Institute\n\nUnited States China Russia Germany United Kingdom Japan India France Canada Ukraine\n\nThose are the countries most responsible for the warming we're already seeing, as well as for much of the warming that we will seen in coming years. According to the World Bank, the atmosphere already has warmed 0.8 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times , and about 1.5 degrees of warming is already \"locked in\" to the atmospheric system because of how much carbon we've burned.\n\nRemember, 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) is the danger mark.\n\nJUST WATCHED 2 degrees Celsius: A critical number for climate change Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 2 degrees Celsius: A critical number for climate change 01:16\n\nFor context, here's a list of the top climate polluters today. They create about 70% of all current greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, according to the World Resources Institute\n\nChina United States European Union India Russia Indonesia Brazil Japan Canada Mexico\n\nAll of this data is a rough guide to help you vote. Each of the four topics you suggested for this poll is a worthy candidate. Our diets, our reliance on fossil fuel reserves, our willingness to turn precious forests into farms and our addiction to gas-burning cars and other dirty modes of transit -- all of these contribute to climate change. And each is worth exploring in depth.\n\nI don't want to play the blame game forever. I agree with those of you who said we need to move past finger-pointing and toward solutions. I do think, however, that by exploring who and what's causing climate change, we'll have a better sense of how to solve this urgent problem.\n\nSo, please vote. Tell your friends. And thank you for helping decide where I'll focus my energy.",

The plunge followed an equally dizzying slump on Tuesday.\n\nKobe Steel has now lost more than 30% of its value in two days since it revealed that employees faked data about the strength and durability of aluminum and copper parts sold between September 2016 and August 2017 to the autos and aerospace industries.\n\nThe crisis deepened Wednesday when the company confirmed that it was also investigating potential falsification of data relating to steel powders, which are also used to make cars.\n\nA Kobe Steel spokesman told CNNMoney that the powders had been sold to one customer, who he declined to identify.\n\nThe falsification scandal has rocked Japanese industry. Toyota (TM), Honda (HMC) and Nissan (NSANF) all bought Kobe products with fake certification, as did Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHVYF) for its new regional passenger jet.\n\nBoeing reviews supplies\n\nSubaru (FUJHF) has also confirmed that it bought affected products. Subaru and Mitsubishi are major suppliers to Boeing (BA).\n\nA Boeing spokesman said the company was inspecting its supply chain for any impacted components.\n\n\"Nothing in our review to date leads us to conclude that this issue presents a safety concern,\" the Boeing spokesman said.\n\nMitsubishi has also said it believes the safety of its plane -- Japan's first commercial airliner for 50 years -- has not been compromised.\n\nIt's still unclear what the unfolding scandal will cost Kobe Steel. It has yet to estimate the financial impact.\n\nStruggle to survive\n\nBut some analysts warn it may struggle to survive.\n\n\"There is a danger Kobe will go bust,\" said Alexander Medd, head of Bucephalus Research, an independent financial research firm based in Hong Kong.\n\nMedd said that Kobe Steel was already facing a crunch because its running costs and investments are higher than the cash its business is generating. Sales and profits have slumped over the last two years.\n\n\"Any drop in sales could be catastrophic,\" Medd added, predicting that foreign customers could ditch Kobe for its competitors.\n\nThe scandal has echoes of another Japanese corporate disaster. Takata was forced to file for bankruptcy earlier this year after faulty parts caused air bags to explode. The scandal was linked to 11 deaths and prompted the recall of millions of vehicles.\n\nRelated: Is Toshiba too big to fail?\n\nThe auto manufacturers drawn into the Kobe scandal all used its metal in vehicle doors and hoods, and they're still trying to figure out which models are affected.\n\nNomura analyst Masataka Kunugimoto said that of the automakers named so far, only Subaru extensively used aluminum hoods across its major models.\n\nKunugimoto added that in the event of any recall Kobe Steel would be made to foot the bill.",

                  "TEXT": "White, Working-Class and Worried is a CNN partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation - an extensive survey of white, working-class Americans and voters, who form a backbone of the support for Donald Trump. Watch Anderson Cooper 360 and CNN.com for reports throughout the week.\n\nWashington (CNN) The white, working-class Americans who form a backbone of Donald Trump's political support have a split view of Muslim immigrants -- strong majorities believe both that immigrants from Muslim countries increase the threat of terrorism in the United States, but also that most immigrants from those countries are good people.\n\nThe data is from a new survey from CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation and is aimed at unveiling the political motivations of the voting bloc that has propelled the GOP nominee.\n\nThreats of terror, both abroad and at home, have repeatedly rolled the race for the White House and the candidates have sought to improve their standing with voters in their responses to the terror attacks in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino, Calif., and most recently after the attacks in New York and New Jersey. Polls generally show that voters trust Trump more than Hillary Clinton to handle terrorism.\n\nTrump's tough talk about combating terrorism and threats abroad, including a plan to erect a wall at the US-Mexico border and his repeated suggestion that profiling as a preventative tactic against terrorism has helped fueled his rise.\n\nWhile a majority (63%) of white, working-class Americans say immigrants from Muslim countries are generally good people, the same share say that immigrants from Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks.\n\nMembers of this group, which exit polls had at around 44% of the US electorate in 2012 though the exact figure is difficult to quantify, also have a more negative view of immigration: nearly half (47%) of whites without a college degree view immigrants as a burden on the country.\n\nEven among those white, working-class voters who view immigrants as a burden, 50% say immigrants from Muslim countries are good people compared with 35% who say they are not.\n\nThere is also a partisan divide: White, working-class Democrats are more likely to hold positive views about immigrants from Muslim countries than their white, working-class Republican counterparts. 47% of white Democrats without college degrees say Muslim immigrants increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US compared with 83% of white Republicans with no college degree.\n\nTrump has made his hard line against Muslims a key component of his campaign, and his white, working-class supporters have strong views about the impact of immigrants from Muslim countries. Fifty-three percent of white voters without college degrees who are considering supporting Trump say immigrants from Muslim countries are basically good, but 82% say they increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US.\n\n'Under attack'\n\nMore than 6-in-10 white, working-class Americans also say that Christian values are under attack in the United States. That viewpoint is more widespread among older working-class whites than among younger ones. Seventy-three % of white, working class adults 65 and older said Christian values are under attack, while just 41% of working-class adults under the age of 30 said the same.\n\nTrump backers were more likely to say that Christian values were under attack than those who support Clinton. Eighty-one percent of white, working-class voters who would consider supporting him in November said Christian values were under attack, compared to 31% who support Clinton.\n\nCandidate positioning\n\nIn the hours following the bombings in New York and New Jersey, Clinton and Trump tussled over who was better qualified to combat terrorism as well as its cause.\n\nClinton cast herself as the candidate best prepared to combat terrorism and said that her opponent's positions are \"not grounded in fact\" and \"meant to make some kind of demagogic point.\"\n\n\"I am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges,\" the former secretary of state told reporters on Monday, \"not engage in a lot of irresponsible, reckless rhetoric.\"\n\nTrump blamed Clinton and President Barack Obama for failing to keep the country safe and called for profiling to beef up what he sees as currently lackluster anti-terrorism efforts. Instead of treading lightly, Trump said on Fox News Monday morning, the better approach would be to \"knock the hell out of 'em.\"\n\n\"Our local police, they know who a lot of these people are,\" Trump told Fox. \"They are afraid to do anything about it, because they don't want to be accused of profiling. And they don't want to be accused of all sorts of things.\"",

                  "TEXT": "(CNN) Egypt manager Héctor Cúper had already been taking medication for high blood pressure to deal with the stress before the game.\n\nNow, with just 60 seconds of added time remaining, star player Mohamed Salah stepped up to take the penalty that could make or break his country's World Cup dream.\n\nTime seemed to slow as Egypt's 27-year wait to reach football's showpiece event came down to a single left-footed strike.\n\nBut Salah calmly dispatched the spot kick into the bottom-right corner and, at last, Cúper could relax -- the Pharaohs had qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time since Italia '90, topping Group E ahead of Uganda, Ghana and Congo with a game to spare.\n\nSo my dads soccer team won and this was the result.... 😭😭😭🇪🇬🇪🇬 pic.twitter.com/3zdHmf0E5P\n\nOvercome by emotion, stadium announcer Inas Mazhar remained silent after Salah's goal.\n\n\"Tears were rolling from the eyes of everyone; the players, the staff on the bench, the security officers,\" Mazhar tells CNN.\n\n\"This means so much for Egypt. We are making history.\"\n\n\"This is an incredible achievement,\" says author James Montague , who has traveled the globe documenting football's intersection with politics.\n\n\"Egypt haven't gone to a World Cup since 1990 and it has been a source of national shame that the Pharaohs had not qualified despite being arguably being the best team in Africa over much of the past decade.\"\n\nQualifying for the World Cup is a significant achievement for a country whose national team suffered when the 2011-12 and 2012-13 domestic seasons were canceled following the Port Said stadium disaster and the 2013 coup d'etat.\n\nIndeed, Egypt were competing at this year's African Cup of Nations (AFCON) for the first time since 2011's Arab Spring swept across the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nMontague added: \"As the country struggled with the revolution's aftermath, we had the Port Said tragedy, the league was canceled, fans were banned from national team games. It was almost as if they would never make it. And then Mohammed Salah stepped up ...\"\n\nWhy age is just a number\n\nPictured from left to right: Gábor Király, Faryd Mondragon and Essam El-Hadary -- the oldest to play in the Euros, World Cup and AFCON respectively.\n\nAs many as 90,000 supporters crowded into the Borg El-Arab Stadium near the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria for Sunday's match. Salah's parents even hired a bus to take people from his home town of Basyoun. Millions more watched in expectation at home.\n\nEgypt this evening after qualifying to World Cup. Football is more than just a game.pic.twitter.com/yf3VzoHb5T — Mootaz Chehade (@MHChehade) October 8, 2017\n\nBut for one man, the Pharaohs' wait to reach the World Cup has been source of particular torment.\n\nWhen goalkeeper and captain Essam El-Hadary made his international debut in 1996, a number of his current teammates weren't even born.\n\nThe 44-year-old has represented his country more than 150 times -- only Italy's Gianluigi Buffon, Spain's Iker Casillas and Mohamed Al-Deayea of Saudi Arabia have played more international games between the sticks -- and has won four AFCON titles, more than many countries.\n\n\"I won 37 trophies and I enjoyed some remarkable moments,\" El-Hadary told FIFA.com. \"The only thing missing for me is a World Cup appearance.\n\n\"I've always been very determined and persistent to carry on playing; this is my character. During my time at Al Ahly, (current Egypt goalkeeping coach) Ahmed Nagui told me I would stop playing after the age of 50.\n\n\"The fact that I still have a chance to play at the World Cup makes me even more motivated to continue playing to realize this dream.\"\n\nShould El-Hadary be selected by Cúper at Russia 2018, he will be 45 years old and the oldest player in World Cup history.\n\nA $85,000 reward\n\nTwelve hours after the final whistle, much of Cairo's population still hasn't slept.\n\nThe national team is meeting with Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and all players are set to receive 1.5 million Egyptian pounds ($85,000).\n\nThe wait is over.\n\nAbsolute SCENES in Egypt tonight — qualified for their first World Cup since 1990!\n\n\n\n📹: @themostafaomar pic.twitter.com/vuOZ04Tlqj — COPA90 US (@COPA90US) October 8, 2017\n\nNigeria has also qualified for Russia 2018, with Africa's remaining three places to be decided in November.",

                  "TEXT": "Sandakan, Sabah, Malaysia (CNN) With his wire-rimmed glasses and mild manner, Siew Te Wong could be described as a Malaysian Clark Kent.\n\nThis wildlife biologist is a Superman of sorts -- a tireless defender of the world's smallest bear species: the sun bear.\n\n\"I often call the sun bear a forgotten species,\" Wong said. \"When I first started, 20 years ago, no one has ever studied sun bears. Most people do not know that they even exist.\"\n\nAs he studied the animal and realized the threats it faced from deforestation and hunting/poaching, he knew the bears were in serious trouble.\n\n\"The more I learn about them, the more I care. The more I care, the more I worry,\" he said. \"I have to help them.\"\n\nToday, Wong's nonprofit, the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre, is the only sun bear sanctuary in the world.\n\nWong -- known as \"Papa Bear\" -- and his team have rehabilitated and cared for 55 rescued sun bears since 2008. The group now also educates the public about these animals.\n\nSun bears are found in the rainforests of south Asia, and the small bears play a big role in keeping these woodlands healthy. Many plants and animals depend on them to spread seeds, create nesting sites and control the termite population -- functions that keep the ecosystems in balance. Healthy rainforests provide clean air and water to the entire world.\n\nBut the sun bear population has decreased by 30% during the last three decades. In 2007, the bear was officially classified as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature\n\nCurrently, 44 sun bears live at Wong's center -- all of them were orphaned by poachers or rescued from captivity. The center has also become one of the leading tourist destinations in the area, helping to raise awareness about the sun bear's plight.\n\nA sun bear explores the forest at the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre.\n\n\"They can see how special the sun bear is and learn about how their survival (is) important to ours,\" Wong said, \"so they can take some action when they go back to home.\"\n\nFor Wong, this work is simply his responsibility.\n\n\"Sun bears became part of my family. When they're endangered, I care for them. When they are in trouble, I speak for them,\" he said. \"I want to be the voice for the sun bear, to fight for the sun bear, to ensure the survival of the sun bear.\"\n\n\"But my ultimate goal is to save the entire forest ecosystem ... that is so important to the survival of mankind.\"\n\nCNN spoke with Wong about his work. Below is an edited version of the conversation.\n\nCNN: How did you get involved with the sun bear?\n\nSiew Te Wong: I grew up keeping different pets and rescuing birds that fell from nests. I always wanted to be an animal expert or a veterinarian. After high school, I went to Taiwan to study veterinary science, and that's where I got involved with studying wildlife. In 1994, I came to the University of Montana to study wildlife biology and I met a professor, Christopher Servheen. He was looking for a Malaysian student to do a study on sun bears. I said, \"I'm your man!\"\n\nCNN: Tell me more about the threats these animals face.\n\nWong: Over the last 50 years, many of the tropical forests in this region have been cleared, and with deforestation, sun bears have lost their habitat. And even though sun bears are a protected species, they are hunted for their meat and their body parts, which are used in traditional Asian medicines. This is literally wiping out local populations.\n\nTheir babies are also kept as illegal pets. Their cubs are really cute, but people don't realize that this baby bear will turn into a destructive beast. In the end, they will either kill the bears or lock (them) in small cages. We are doing lots of educational awareness to make sure that people don't keep bears anymore.\n\nCNN: How do the animals spend their time at the center?\n\nWong: Every day after breakfast, we release the bears into the forest enclosure. This is where they learn to forage, climb trees, build nests and socialize. All of those activities help them get ready to be released and survive in the forest.\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN Hero Siew Te Wong: Sun bears are not pets Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Hero Siew Te Wong: Sun bears are not pets 02:43\n\nAt 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., we give the bears different fruits, and at 4pm, the bears come back and have dinner in the bear house. We keep them inside at night because this level of bear density in the forest is not natural. We also want to monitor their well-being. However, there are a few bears left out for the night, which is good. One day, they will live there all the time.\n\nCNN: How many bears have you been able to release?\n\nWong: We have released two bears so far, and this year we plan to release four more. There are many bears that we cannot release because they were in captivity for a long time. They lost their instinct to find food, they're habituated to people, and many that were rescued as adults cannot climb trees. There are also bears who (were) malnourished or who had their claws chopped off. They don't have the skills to survive in the forest, so they have to stay here for the rest of their lives.\n\nHopefully in the future, there'll be more bears ready to be released. I want bears to live in the forest and not in captivity. (That) is where they belong. It is their home.\n\nWant to get involved?

                  "TEXT": "Washington (CNN) Between the ruthless executions of his own senior officers, bombastic threats of nuclear annihilation and defiant missile tests, it may be easy to agree with President Donald Trump's recent assessment that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is a \"madman\" who is \"on a suicide mission for himself.\"\n\nBut top officials from the CIA said Wednesday that Kim's actions are not those of a maniacal provocateur but a \"rational actor\" who is motivated by clear, long-term goals that revolve around ensuring regime survival.\n\n\"There's a clarity of purpose in what Kim Jong Un has done,\" according to Yong Suk Lee, deputy assistant director of the CIA's Korea Mission Center, who discussed the escalating tensions between North Korea and the US during a conference organized by the agency at George Washington University.\n\nMany experts say they believe North Korea would not use the weapons first. Kim values his regime's survival above all else and knows the use of a nuclear weapon would start a war he could not win, analysts say.\n\nPyongyang looks at states such as Iraq -- where Saddam Hussein was overthrown by the United States -- and Libya -- its late leader, Moammar Gadhafi, gave up his nuclear ambitions for sanctions relief and aid, only to be toppled and killed after the United States intervened in his country's civil unrest -- and believes that only being able to threaten the US mainland with a retaliatory nuclear strike can stop American military intervention.\n\nNorth Korea has long maintained it wants nuclear weapons and long-range missiles to deter the United States from attempting to overthrow the regime of Kim Jong Un.\n\n\"Waking up one morning and deciding he wants to nuke\" Los Angeles is not something Kim Jong Un is likely to do, Lee said. \"He wants to rule for a long time and die peacefully in his own bed.\"\n\nAnd for CIA officers, diplomats and lawmakers tasked with utilizing intelligence to protect the US and its allies from the security threats posed by North Korea, understanding that purpose could prove to be key in avoiding a potentially devastating military conflict.\n\nMixed messaging\n\nUS-led efforts to apply additional diplomatic pressure on North Korea in recent months have been met with greater defiance as the Kim regime continues to march toward realizing its nuclear ambitions.\n\nDespite assurances from Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that the US continues to seek a peaceful resolution, neither side has overtly indicated that it is ready or willing to engage in serious negotiations.\n\nThe mixed-messages coming from the Trump administration also continue to raise questions about the US approach to North Korea.\n\nTrump has repeatedly undercut comments made by his top officials and publicly engaged in a war of words with Kim that has devolved into insults and name-calling -- only raising fears of an eventual military conflict.\n\n\"When they hear what's coming from the President, I think it resonates with them,\" said Ambassador Joseph R. DeTrani, who previously served at the Department of State as the Special Envoy for Six-Party Talks with North Korea.\n\n\"But they also know we have a process and I think right now they're probing,\" he said.\n\nTrump said Thursday the US will \"do what we must do\" to prevent further threats from North Korea.\n\n\"We cannot allow this dictatorship to threaten our nation or our allies with unimaginable loss of life,\" he said at a meeting with top military officers.\n\n\"We will do what we must do to prevent that from happening and it will be done if necessary, believe me.\"\n\nBut while Trump continues to publicly paint Kim as an irrational dictator, CIA officials said the intelligence community views the North Korean leader's actions through a different lens.\n\n\"The last person who wants conflict on the peninsula is actually Kim Jong Un,\" Lee said. \"We have a tendency in this country and elsewhere to underestimate the conservatism that runs in these authoritarian regimes.\"\n\nRuthless purges\n\nWhile Kim may not want a war with the US, he does view the strategy of perpetuating a confrontational relationship as a key to maintaining his grip on power, according to Lee and Michael Collins, deputy assistant director of the east Asia and Pacific mission center at the CIA.\n\n\"North Korea is a political organism that thrives on confrontation,\" Lee said.\n\nSince succeeding his father in 2011, Kim's rise from political novice to adept operator has stemmed from a calculated commitment to consolidating power within his own regime and transforming North Korea into a nuclear state.\n\nInternally, Kim has demonstrated a willingness to purge those who might pose a threat to his rule.\n\nOne report from a South Korean think tank, the Institute for National Security Strategy, claims he has ordered the executions of at least 340 people since he came to power -- 140 of whom were senior officers in the country's government, military and ruling Korean Worker's Party.\n\nIn 2013 he executed his own uncle , Jang Song Thaek. By making it particularly visible, with state media declaring Jang a \"traitor for all ages,\" Kim made sure there was no dissent to the decision.\n\nHe is also accused of ordering the assassination of his half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, earlier this year in Malaysia but North Korea has repeatedly and vehemently denied any involvement.\n\nWhile ruthless and violent, Kim's behavior fits the profile of a leader acting out of his own self-interest, rather than emotion or impulse, Lee said -- a theme that is consistent in his dealings with the US as well.\n\n\"Kim's long-term goal is to come to some sort of big power agreement with the US and to remove US presence from the peninsula,\" Lee said, adding he wants to make North Korea relevant on the global stage again.\n\nBut Kim's efforts to develop a reliable long-range nuclear weapon have long conflicted with the security priorities of the US and its allies in the region -- a concern that has become more urgent in recent months in the wake of several successful missile and nuclear tests.\n\n\"North Korea is clearly testing the patience of the US and international community,\" Collins said. \"With each increasing escalation, they're raising the threshold for the United States and others to accept or press back against that.\"\n\nBut Kim seems undeterred by Trump's threats despite the US President telling the United Nations General Assembly last month that Kim is \"on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.\"\n\nChina's influence overstated?\n\nKim's actions indicate he is no longer constrained by fears that China might abandon its support for his regime or that the US will launch a military strike -- two major factors that have tempered Pyongyang's boldness in the past, according to Lee.\n\nUnbounded by those fears, the situation \"becomes a tolerance of wills,\" Lee said, adding now the question is \"how far will Kim Jong Un go?\"\n\nCollins and Lee both emphasized that China could still wield significant influence over North Korea but said Beijing would have to make the choice of prioritizing its relationship with the US over the strategic benefits of backing Pyongyang.\n\n\"China's strategic goal is to frustrate US and maintain division of peninsula,\" Lee said, adding that the US must continue to demonstrate to both Beijing and Pyongyang that all options remain on the table through shows of military force.\n\n\"First and foremost, the situation with North Korea is a test of what China wants in its relationship with US,\" Collins added.\n\nAccording to Collins, the intelligence community is currently wrestling with questions related to North Korea's resolve and monitoring how major players in the region respond to Pyongyang's provocations in an effort to gauge how far the Kim regime is willing to push the envelope.\n\nKim remains unlikely to intentionally start a war with the US or its allies like South Korea as that would almost certainly result in his own destruction, according to Collins and Lee, but both CIA officials said they anticipate tensions with North Korea will continue -- raising the risk of a miscalculation from both sides.\n\n\"The South Korean and North Korean Navy's are going toe-to-toe every day ... there is potential for conflict at anytime,\" Lee said.\n\n\"We could stumble into something,\" DeTrani said, noting a potential scenario in which the US shoots down a North Korean missile deemed to be an imminent threat and prompting a response from Pyongyang.\n\nAnd while the prospect of a North Korean preemptive strike on the US or one of its allies remains unlikely, DeTrani admitted that \"there is a sense that North Korea is unpredictable if put into a corner.\"",

Here they are always with their doors open for dialogue, but I think this will end badly,\" he said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Why these Catalans are against independence Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why these Catalans are against independence 01:19\n\nUnless there is a U-turn, he said, the Spanish state \"will annul the autonomy, more repression, more police forces and we will have a military intervention.\"\n\nAparici said the motivation for Catalonia's separatists has always been gaining greater fiscal autonomy.\n\n\"We're subsidizing Andalucia, we're subsidizing Extremadura, we're subsidizing, subsidizing, subsidizing ... and it comes a time where we don't feel like subsidizing any more. So the only thing that could happen here is that, by force, they make us carry on subsidizing,\" he said.\n\n\"This is what we wanted with the referendum, to know if we were the majority or not.\"\n\n'They have made us angry'\n\nMireya Jimenez says Madrid's handling of the October 1 referendum has made Catalans angry.\n\nMireya Jimenez, 25, a journalism student, said the way the October 1 referendum was handled has hardened people's views in favor of independence. Hundreds of people were injured last weekend as police sent from Madrid tried to prevent the referendum going ahead.\n\n\"I didn't feel that repressed until what happened on October 1,\" she said. \"I think a couple of years ago there were more people who didn't want it (independence), but after all that has happened, I think there are more people who want it.\n\n\"I don't think there is turning around. I think that whatever they do, they have made us angry, and I think we have seen that a ... part of Spain doesn't like us, the King doesn't like us either and so I think that, also because of how they've treated us just now, there is no turning back.\"\n\nJimenez said she doesn't feel represented by Spain because of its policies and the way it treats Catalans.\n\n\"I believe that by being independent we could ... manage ourselves better; we would have another kind of benefits that don't exist within Spain,\" she said.\n\n'A better country'\n\nRaul del Hoyo says he believes Catalonia has the potential to be a better country on its own.\n\nRaul del Hoyo, 56, a logistics technician, said he feels Spanish as well as Catalan but believes in the region's bid for independence.\n\n\"We believe we have sufficient economic potential, social cohesion and initiative to be able to make a better country,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm very sad to have seen how the police took people who were only expressing or demonstrating, democratically, their right to vote, and their right to demonstrate on the street in order to achieve a political objective.\"\n\nHe said he believes there will be negotiations and that the two sides will find a solution that works for them both.\n\n\"There could be violence, but if there is violence, I am sure it will be institutional. Catalonia, for decades, not just now, for decades, has always demonstrated democratically its claims,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the part of the peninsula, or the part of Spain, that has always voted more in favor of Europe, of democratic values, of its anti-Franco struggle. It's a peaceful people, a people that organized itself around a set of values to grow more. We're not going against anything.\"\n\n'They didn't listen to us'\n\nAna, a retiree, says she hopes for dialogue to resolve the situation peacefully.\n\nAna, who didn't want to give her last name for fear of repercussions, said Catalan independence is essential.\n\n\"We need to have it. So that all of us take everything that the state from Madrid takes from us,\" she said.\n\nA 68-year-old retired administrative executive, Ana has been angered by the central authorities' treatment of Catalans in recent days.\n\n\"We've been very peaceful. They didn't listen to us and attacked the people, elderly people, children, very bad,\" she said.\n\n\"We hope that they engage in dialogue, that they talk and they fix this because we've never had an issue, between people who don't want independence and people who want it.\"\n\nShe said she hopes the recent tensions won't deter foreign visitors to Barcelona and the region, saying they will be welcomed with open arms.",

                  "TEXT": "(CNN) Off the coast of Georgia lies a quiet island, accessible only by boat and home to about 50 year-round residents -- all descendants of slaves.\n\nSapelo Island is a tangle of marsh and farmland, and its residents are known as Saltwater Geechees.\n\nThis remote culture has survived years of displacement and migration from their island. With little resources available, Saltwater Geechees have learned to live off the land, fishing local waters and growing much of their own food.\n\n\"I'm what you refer to as a 'beenhere,' \" joked Cornelia Walker Bailey, a Sapelo resident and vice president of the Sapelo Island Cultural and Revitalization Society. \"It means I've always been here.\"\n\nBailey is one of the last residents born and raised in Hog Hammock, the sole community still owned by residents on Sapelo. Many are moving to the mainland to be closer to schools and possible income.\n\nIn an effort to revitalize the island and preserve their culture, Bailey wants to bring residents back by using agriculture, specifically the Sapelo Island red pea. Red peas, their origins in Sierra Leone, have been growing in residents' gardens for centuries.\n\n\"We will always have a backyard or a side yard with red peas in it. We want to grow more ... so we can hire young people, so they can come back home and plant peas,\" Bailey said.\n\nA pea with history\n\nBailey has paired up with Dr. William Thomas, physician and owner of the Sapelo Island Birdhouses. The man known affectionately as Doc Bill has invested many years in the revitalization of Sapelo. When this opportunity came up, he joined Jerome Dixon of Georgia Coastal Gourmet Farms to start the Sapelo Island Red Pea Project.\n\n\"To get people involved in a project, they have to have an interest in it. It has to be something they identify with,\" Thomas said, \"and the red pea is something they brought from Africa to the Georgia coast, and that has strong ties.\"\n\nHe says everyone in the community is familiar with the pea. \"They eat it in dishes, they know how it grows, and they have a whole culture of planting and harvesting it.\"\n\nNow in its third year, the Red Pea Project has increased overall production land to 5 acres.\n\nA large part of this growth is the partnership with the mainland's Georgia Coastal Gourmet Farms. Dixon's family came from Sapelo generations ago and has farmed this area of the mainland for more than 60 years.\n\nToday, the project grows three heirloom crops with history in Georgia: Sapelo Island red peas, Sapelo Island purple ribbon sugar cane and sour oranges.\n\n\"I'm really excited about the purple ribbon sugar cane,\" Dixon said. \"My grandfather directly planted that particular variety. To be able to handle things he handled is exciting.\"\n\nPreserving Geechee foodways\n\nDixon remains closely tied to the Geechee culture and enthusiastic about preserving Geechee foodways.\n\n\"Sapelo Island red peas were brought to Sapelo Island by slaves from Africa who worked on the plantation,\" he said. \"You look at stuff that has not been grown since the 1800s, when slaves were forced to grow the crops. Now, people like myself are able to do it at our leisure.\"\n\nHeirloom crops, like the Sapelo Island red pea and purple ribbon sugar cane, are more than just history. The diversity of the products give chefs more options.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSapelo Island red peas are about the same size as any other pea. \"However, they are genetically distinct from commercial or modern varieties. They are unique in color, texture and taste,\" Dixon said, elaborating on the significance of diversity. \"By eating and seeing this crop grow gives consumers a sense of importance to making sure another great heirloom variety thrives 50 more years.\"\n\nDixon admits that farming heirloom crops requires attention to detail. Using farm machinery from the past is an important when working with heirloom plants. Georgia Costal Gourmet Farms is also working toward organic certification. According to the USDA, there is a three-year process to transition farmland to organic standards.\n\nDixon believes in offering a quality product. \"With food, the way it is today, growing crops the way our ancestors used to will make us a better community. And they will continue to tell the story of the places and people that helped preserved them. \"",

                  "TEXT": "Jonathon Morgan is the CEO of New Knowledge , a cognitive security startup, and founder of Data for Democracy , a global volunteer tech collective. Previously he advised the White House and State Department during the Obama administration about combating terrorist propaganda online. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(CNN) Every day we learn more about the scale and effectiveness of Russian influence operations during the 2016 US election. The implications for our political process are ominous, but the problem runs much deeper. For years hostile foreign governments, terrorist groups, and armies of internet trolls have manipulated public discussion, both in the United States and around the world.\n\nWe must understand Russia's manipulative attack during last year's presidential elections in a broader context: as a relatively traditional propaganda operation that achieved unprecedented reach because social media companies are either unable or choose not to defend themselves.\n\nEvery time our society falls victim to an information attack, we blame the attacker, but not their weapons. It's hard to accept that the platforms we use to chat with friends and share baby photos can have such a powerful impact in shaping democracy. Platforms like Google, Facebook, and Twitter have fundamental flaws that must be fixed if we're going to protect ourselves in the future.\n\nAt its peak in 2013, ISIS mobilized tens of thousands of social media accounts to spread their message and radicalize Americans. They created horrific but compelling content, and used their social bot armies to force that content into the mainstream. They were manipulating the underlying mechanics of social media, tricking platforms like Twitter, Tumblr, and YouTube into amplifying their message to the widest possible audience.\n\nISIS lit a fuse with its message of hate and violence, but these social media platforms powered the explosion, making it simple to share and spread nearly instantaneously. Years later, tech companies have finally acknowledged the severity of the problem, establishing the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism in June, 2017.\n\nThe terrorist group's years-long, highly visible manipulation of our social platforms was a clear warning that hostile actors could use our online gathering places to target Americans. The warning was ignored, and in 2016 we were attacked again. In October, 2016, Obama administration intelligence officials formally accused Russia of meddling in US elections. By March of 2017, New Knowledge, along with independent researchers from our volunteer collective, Data for Democracy, discovered 30,000 accounts that exhibited bot-like behavior in posting on the Trump campaign's Facebook page alone. Fake accounts, run by software programs, are designed to imitate real users and manufacture popular support by repeatedly posting messages to social media.\n\nYet only now, 11 months after the 2016 election, are we beginning to realize the cost. We have recently learned that millions of Americans were served propaganda by a foreign adversary, disguised as news stories and as persuasive comments by fake neighbors. The tech companies that enabled this continue to accept only limited responsibility, reframing the problem as an issue of free speech rather than admitting that their users were fooled and manipulated.\n\nYet again, as the country reeled from the deadliest mass shooting in the US history, Google and Facebook promoted fake news about the attacks. 4chan, an anonymous message board infamous for its racist and misogynist content, falsely accused an innocent man of being the Las Vegas shooter.\n\nDespite 4chan's reputation as a hotbed of offensive memes and wild conspiracy theories, Google promoted the content in its Top Stories search results and Facebook promoted 4chan messages on its crisis response page -- which was supposed to be a resource for families checking to see if their loved ones were injured or killed in the attack. Both companies released statements expressing regret for the mistakes and ultimately corrected the issues.\n\nThese information attacks continue because manipulating these platforms is cheap and easy. Media platforms like Google, Twitter, and Facebook rely on trust. If enough people trust that a piece of information is valuable, it is promoted to more users. It doesn't matter where the information was published, who authored it, or what it contains.\n\nAt one time, this kind of democratic sharing of ideas was the great promise of the internet, where information flowed freely, unconstrained by traditional gatekeepers like government or media companies.\n\nHowever the internet is not a democracy. Information is controlled by a cartel of media companies, who are not motivated to help their users share information, but rather to profit off of their attention. Google, Facebook, and Twitter know that their businesses profit by deeply understanding their users, and the type of content that captures each individual user's attention.\n\nTheir algorithms learn what information attracts attention, then in turn promote that content to exactly the users who are most likely to consume and share it, which in turn gives that content more attention, and generates more profit. As a society, we communicate with each other using products that aren't designed to help us communicate — they're designed to keep us watching.\n\nThe flaws in this system are baked into its design. These flaws have been repeatedly exploited, and we're still vulnerable. We're vulnerable to content that grabs our attention, regardless of its veracity or substance. We're vulnerable to targeting systems that understand our preferences, our beliefs, and our politics, and can show attention-grabbing, influential content to exactly the people most likely to be manipulated by it. And we're vulnerable to automation -- fake accounts that invent, share, and amplify information to fool tech company algorithms into believing information will be valuable in capturing their users' attention.\n\nAddressing these complex problems will require significant investment from tech companies, who need to rethink how information is shared and promoted on their platforms. They need new models for promoting content that assess the quality, not just quantity, of user engagement.\n\nIn the short term, they need to follow through on promises to flag false or misleading information, and commit to labeling automated accounts so users can distinguish between what real humans believe, and what bots want us to believe.\n\nMost importantly, tech companies need to accept that they don't operate in a vacuum -- Facebook and Google have revolutionized how we communicate as a society. These platforms are where Americans engage in public discourse, and are therefore fundamental to our modern democracy. Every tech worker and executive has an ethical responsibility to protect our democratic ideals.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIt's also time for a sober conversation about government regulation. As a society, we need to decide whether a small number of giant tech companies should be restricted in mining the data they collect about every aspect of lives. We need to decide if we trust these companies to control the information we consume, even when that gives them the control to shape our elections.\n\nTogether, the tech industry and government need to deal with the structural problems in our media platforms. Otherwise we can expect to be victims again.",

                  "TEXT": "(CNN) Every time a new telescope has been turned on, we have learned something fundamental about our universe.\n\nGalileo's first telescope saw the moons of Jupiter and forever destroyed the idea that the Earth was at the center of the universe. Edwin Hubble used the Mount Wilson Observatory in 1917 to show that other galaxies exist and that the Milky Way was but one of many.\n\nThe Vela satellites orbiting the Earth in the 1960s were designed to detect the gamma rays that accompany a nuclear explosion. They worked for that purpose, but they also discovered gamma ray bursts from space, which was eventually identified as the explosion of a star so violent that they could be seen across the entire universe.\n\nWednesday, scientists made a momentous announcement resulting from the latest form of \"telescopes\" -- detectors of gravitational waves. And the scientists instrumental in the detection have now been awarded the Nobel Prize.\n\nWhat they revealed is the observation of a cosmic calamity.\n\nLiterally a long time ago and in a galaxy far, far away, two black holes , locked for eons in a dance of death, finally slammed into one another. Over the course of a few milliseconds, energy equivalent to the mass of three stars the size of our sun was released as gravitational waves that roared across the cosmos.\n\nGravitational waves occur when the fabric of space and time are distorted by the movement of large masses. Their existence was predicted in 1916 by Albert Einstein. In this announcement, black holes with the masses of 31 and 25 solar masses merged into a larger black hole with a mass 53 times that of our sun.\n\nFor that brief instant, the gravitational energy emitted by that collision outshined all of the light emitted by all the galaxies throughout the known universe. After traveling for about 1.8 billion light years, the death scream of these two ancient stars passed through the Earth.\n\nOn August 14, three detectors recorded the passage of these gravitational waves. Two detectors in the United States -- one in Hanford, Washington, and the other in Livingston, Louisiana -- are called the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO . The other detector, located near Pisa, Italy, is called Virgo\n\nAll three detectors are L-shaped, with each leg being about two miles long. Using lasers and mirrors, these phenomenal pieces of scientific equipment are able to measure tiny changes in the length of the legs of the detectors and identify the passage of gravitational waves.\n\nIn February 2016, scientists announced that the first direct observation of gravitational waves had been made using just the two LIGO detectors. That was followed by a second announcement in June 2016. Because Virgo was undergoing an extensive upgrade, it was not operating during these first observations.\n\nVirgo's upgrades were completed and the facility became operational August 1, and thus it also recorded the gravitational waves of August 14.\n\nGravitational wave source areas are mapped across the sky in this graphic. Note how much smaller the GW170814 area is -- indicating the higher precision we have in locating the source with three detectors.\n\nThe addition of a third facility is an enormous improvement in capability. Like seismographs on Earth, gravitational wave detectors are non-directional and individually cannot determine the location from which the gravitational waves originated. However, by employing multiple detectors and carefully recording the arrival time of gravitational waves at each detector, scientists can triangulate and vastly improve the directional precision of the measurement.\n\nBy including Virgo with the two LIGO measurements, scientists' measurements of the location in the sky from which the waves originated was improved tenfold. A proposed additional facility in India called Indigo that is an exact copy of the LIGO equipment will result in an even greater improvement if it is built.\n\nSo why are gravitational wave observatories interesting?\n\nWell, the simplest answer is that they can verify that Einstein's theory of general relativity is right, but that's actually not a very satisfying one. There have already been many other tests of general relativity, including the simple fact that the GPS on your phone would simply not work if the theory were not correct\n\nA better answer involves astronomy. Black holes are just that -- black. They are the corpses of dead stars, so massive and compact that not even light can escape them. They literally cannot be seen, and before LIGO came online, their existence could only be inferred by their gravitational effect on their neighbors or because of light (often X-rays) emitted by hot gas falling into the black hole\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nBut an isolated black hole is invisible. It interacts via gravity and, even then, it only emits gravitational radiation when it is moving. So detectors like LIGO or Virgo are the only way to see them. They are essentially black hole telescopes.\n\nWith even just a few observations of gravitational waves, the LIGO measurements have already perplexed scientists. Prior to 2016, astronomers thought that there were two classes of black holes: stellar-class black holes, with masses no more than about 10 times that of our sun, and massive, monstrous black holes at the center of galaxies with masses in the range of hundreds of thousands to billions of solar masses.\n\nBlack holes with masses in the range of 30 solar masses or so were unexpected . And yet, that's just what LIGO (and now LIGO plus Virgo) have observed.\n\nIf history teaches us anything, it's that a new telescope means we should expect the unexpected. Studying gravitational waves will teach us something that can't be observed in any other way. There's no way to know what we'll learn. But I am positive that it will be fascinating.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article said that scientists made the first direct observation of gravitational waves in February, 2016. In fact, that was the month they announced the observation, which had been made in September, 2015.",

                  "TEXT": "On Christmas Eve 1959, two men drew swastikas on the wall of the house of worship, along with the phrase, \"Germans Demand That Jews Get Out.\" Within days, Jews began receiving menacing anonymous phone calls, as Jewish grave sites and Jewish-owned shops were desecrated in over twenty towns and cities in West Germany.\n\nFrom there, the desecrations went \"viral,\" to use the sufficiently creepy contemporary term for an old-fashioned phenomenon. By New Year's, the fallen symbol of the Third Reich had sprung up in New York, London, Paris, Stockholm, Oslo, Milan, Copenhagen, Perth, Athens, Buenos Aires, and Bogota. The summer home of Denmark's king was graffitied. A Jewish MP in Britain was threatened with murder.\n\nComing just fourteen years after the liberation of the camps, the reaction to such recrudescent race hatred was swift and furious. One British peer vowed to wage a personal investigation in West Germany to determine for himself the extent of the \"rising tide of Nazism\" in its former epicenter. Honorable West Germans were appalled and self-critical in a manner bordering on masochistic.\n\nThe American press reopened wounds that were not quite healed yet, even with the balm of so much Marshall aid. \"Bonn Unable to Eliminate Nazi Poison,\" ran one headline in the New York Herald Tribune, as the poet Carl Sandburg let his anti-fascist fervor get the better of his liberal judgment. Anyone caught daubing Hitler's symbol, he said, should be executed.\n\nThe campaign of anti-Semitism even took an economic toll, as German employees were sacked from British-owned companies, some of which also canceled contracts with West German partners. A reconstructed postwar nation that had only just acceded to NATO four years earlier was thus faced with the humiliating question from the founding members of the alliance: Was German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer's Federal Republic de-Nazified enough to be granted such a strategic privilege?\n\n\"Between Christmas Eve 1959 and mid-February 1960,\" the American journalist John Barron later recounted, \"West German authorities recorded 833 separate anti-Jewish acts. Then the epidemic ceased almost as suddenly as and mysteriously as it had begun. Police arrested and interrogated 234 people. Analyzing their motives, the government concluded that 24% acted out of 'subconscious Nazi motives;' 8% were inspired by extreme rightist or leftist beliefs; 48% were drunks or thugs; 15% were children; and 5% were mentally deranged.\"\n\nCase, then, seemingly closed -- but for a few oddities diagnosed in Patient Zero of this epidemic. The two men who had inaugurated the spree of defacements in Cologne had belonged to a minuscule West German neo-Nazi party but, as Barron noted, the authorities discovered \"that they frequently made trips to East Germany and one had a Communist Party badge hidden behind his coat lapel.\"\n\nIn a separate incident, the 22-year-old treasurer of a different fascist organization was arrested and admitted to the police that he was an East German agent whose mission was to infiltrate far-right groups in West Germany and whip up anti-Semitic sentiment. All of which fed the suspicion in Bonn that the simultaneity of these hate crimes hinted at something more than grim coincidence.\n\nIt would take a few more years, when defectors from the GDR stole across the Berlin Wall, for the true provenance of the \"swastika graffiti operation\" to become known.\n\nAn operation is exactly what it was, too, cooked up by General Ivan Ivanovich Agayants, who headed Department D of the First Chief Directorate of the Soviet KGB. The \"D\" stood for Dezinformatsiya, or disinformation, and Agayants, an austere ethnic Armenian, was very good at his job. During his tenure, he oversaw the forgery of documents alleging that the CIA planned to assassinate Indonesian President Sukarno and eliminate Turkish military officials and political actors in the interest of the then-ruling center-right Justice Party.\n\nThe 58-year-old provocation may have been a tactical success, but it was a strategic failure: West Germany stayed in NATO and remained an intact liberal democracy immune from the restoration of Hitlerism well into reunification with its eastern neighbor. But the swastika graffiti campaign remains a vivid case study of a poisonous weapon used for decades, not only by the Soviets, but also by their heir, Russian President Vladimir Putin, a former KGB lieutenant colonel, in trying to influence western nations, including the course of American democracy.\n\nTo hear some pundits tell it, Donald Trump's election to the presidency was itself a triumph of Russian espionage based purely on the Moscow-linked proliferation of \"fake news\" and dubiously purchased advertisements on social media.\n\nYet this ignores the subtlety of such influence operations, which, as in any con, rely on the willingness of their targets to be duped or cajoled or simply nudged further in the same dangerous direction they were already heading. The Russians were only as effective as the gullible or tendentious Americans they influenced. The same was actually true of Agayants' dark arts in 1959.\n\nMaking the West look weak\n\nAgayants had observed that the immediate reaction to the initial bout of anti-Semitism in 1959 was revulsion and embarrassment, which only made West Germany look weak and defensive. If just a few Nazi symbols and slogans prompted international scorn and boycotts, not to mention Western acts of prostration, imagine what a whole contagion of them might do in US-aligned nations around the globe?\n\nAgayants even established a stage-crafted pogrom to test his anthropological hypothesis. He selected a village 50 miles outside of Moscow and dispatched a team of KGB agents there. \"One night,\" wrote Barron in his book, \"KGB: The Secret Work of Soviet Secret Agents,\" \"they smeared swastikas, kicked over tombstones, and painted anti-Jewish slogans, then escaped undetected. KGB agents stationed in the village to gauge the public reaction reported that most people were disturbed or frightened by the swastikas. But appearance of the Nazi insignia also awakened latent anti-Semitism among a few Russians and inspired them to commit a variety of anti-Jewish acts on their own. Some weeks after this trial run in the Soviet village, the KGB began the operation, relying upon East Germans in West Germany and its own agents in other parts of the world.\"\n\nAgayants' men acted as stokers rather than inventors of social pathologies, and so plausible deniability was built right into the heart of their deception. Who could possibly mistake the return of Judeophobia in Central Europe for a false flag perpetrated by Moscow Center? And how false was it if, as Agayants realized, one lit match could start a conflagration so easily?\n\nPlanting in fertile soil\n\nDisinformation as practiced by the Soviet and now Russian security services works best when the lie it peddles contains an element of verisimilitude or the germ of verifiable fact, however cleverly cocooned in falsehoods. William Blake put the matter better than Yuri Andropov ever could have when he wrote, \"A Truth that's told with bad intent/ Beats all the Lies you can invent.\"\n\nOutlandish conspiracy theories -- the CIA created AIDS to destroy inner-city black communities and also assassinated JFK -- may become fringe urban myths or Oliver Stone biopics. Smarter efforts to undermine the West are rooted in smarter understandings of the West and its social and political pressure points. It is always easier to co-opt than to create anew. And because lingering or resurgent neo-Nazism was a problem in West Germany in 1959, even if not to the extent exaggerated by Agayants, the swastika graffiti operation succeeded in two ways.\n\nFirst, it undermined and subverted an enemy nation, as intended. Second, it \"helped East Germany legitimize itself as a peace loving, antifascist state,\" as Anton Shekhovtsov, a Vienna-based scholar of European fascism, argues in his timely and exhaustively researched new book, \"Russia and the Western Far Right: Tango Noir.\"\n\nAs with many KGB operations, this one had the added virtue of Freudian projection: accusing the West of that which the East was guilty. The East German regime, Shekhovtsov reminds us, was not above rehabilitating and suborning former agents of Hitler to agitate on behalf of their new socialist fatherland. The Communist-controlled and perfectly misnamed National-Democratic Party of Germany (NDPD), for example, \"helped form, during the 1950s, 'numerous pressure groups, newspapers, and \"study circles\" for former officers' through its West German contacts among former Nazis and Wehrmacht officers,\" he writes. \"For (these) purposes, the NDPD received 700,000 East German Marks a month from a Soviet bank.\"\n\nNearly 60 years later, the projection is even more brazen. Even as contemporary Russian state propaganda vilifies the Baltic states or Ukraine as fascist-led regimes, it makes no effort to obfuscate its own support of far-right European political organizations, from Hungary's longtime anti-Semitic Jobbik to Italy's Lega Nord to France's Front National.\n\nThe leading lights of all of these groups have been personally welcomed in Moscow by Sergey Naryshkin, himself a former KGB officer who formerly served as the chairman of Russia's State Duma and Putin's chief of staff, and now heads the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service. (In 2014, Le Front National even obtained a €9 million loan from the First Czech-Russian Bank, a now bankrupt institution which was connected to Gennady Timchenko, a US-sanctioned Russian oligarch and member of Vladimir Putin's inner circle.)\n\nAs part of the Kremlin's \"tolerated\" or \"systemic\" opposition is the perfectly misnamed Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, long believed to have been established by the KGB and headed by the cartoonish reactionary Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has written of his desire to see Russia restored as an empire, with colonial holdings including modern Turkey, Afghanistan and Iran, and counts among his overseas associates Holocaust deniers , according to Shekhovtsov.\n\nAll the while, the Kremlin has played the courted rather than courter of far-right extremists, having naturally attracted them through a well-advertised suspicion of homosexuality, Muslim immigration, Arab revolutions, NATO, the European Union and, above all, the American-led postwar international order. It is to the Kremlin's credit that it predicted so many Americans would share in this worldview, too.\n\nMeddling in the US election\n\nOne cannot open a US newspaper or news website without reading of some fresh piece of evidence that Russian intelligence operatives, now answerable to the former KGB lieutenant colonel Vladimir Putin, meddled in the last US election by buying demographically targeted advertisements on social media platforms or digitally masquerading as Americans of diverse, and at times contradictory, political orientations.\n\nThe overriding goal was the same, however: portray a superpower in terminal decline, ruined by violent race wars and a plundering plutocracy, and hollowed out by imperial overstretch.\n\nFor a mere $100,000, which is reportedly what cutouts of the Russian government spent on Facebook advertisements, the technology officer of one digital marketing firm told the Washington Post, hundreds of millions of viewers could have been reached.\n\nFacebook, now embroiled in a PR crisis which forced it to turn over 470 \"Russian-linked accounts\" to Congress as part of an ongoing multicommittee investigation into Russian interference in the US electoral system, says this damage assessment is overdramatic. The ads bought by a hostile foreign power were probably only seen by about 10 million people.\n\nFalse online personae, many of them traced back to the much-scrutinized Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, have posed as Second Amendment absolutists , LGBT rights activists, American Muslim community activists, American anti-Muslim activists, Texas and California secessionists, pro-Trump Floridians and Jill Stein supporters, of which there are evidently real-world specimens.\n\nAs CNN reported , a \"number of Russian-linked Facebook ads specifically targeted Michigan and Wisconsin, two states crucial to Donald Trump's victory last November, according to four sources with direct knowledge of the situation.\" Trump won Michigan by 10,700 votes and Wisconsin by 22,700 -- a margin of less than 1% in either state.\n\nIn one particularly imaginative case, redolent of the Luddite old days when KGB illegals would trawl cemeteries looking for viable \"legends\" to assume, Russian operatives even posed as a now-defunct grassroots nonprofit called \"United Muslims of America.\" The Daily Beast broke the story of the Facebook group that was \"neither united, Muslim, nor American\" but nonetheless tried to convince its followers that Sen. John McCain founded ISIS and Osama bin Laden was a CIA agent.\n\nPerhaps most insidious of all was the online incarnation known as \"Blacktivist,\" whose Facebook page garnered more likes than the one belonging to Black Lives Matter, whose cause it pretended to champion. Blacktivist even feigned contrition and humility when criticized by a savvy black pastor and civil rights activist in Baltimore who rightly suspected the account wasn't quite as homegrown as it made out. That was after it had promoted rallies and demonstrations across the United States against police brutality and racism.\n\n\"We are fed up with government ignorance and the system failing black people,\" said the Blacktivist Facebook page , maintained in Russia, promoting an all-too-real march in Baltimore in honor of Freddie Gray, an event duly covered by RT, the network which has also presented American white supremacist Richard Spencer as an expert on Syria and Libya.\n\nPerhaps most ominous was a white supremacist rally in protest of an Islamic Center in Houston, Texas. At least one anti-Muslim demonstrator who turned up carried an AR-15. The small demonstration, which drew a larger counter-protest, was organized by a Facebook group calling itself \"Heart of Texas\" but was run, as CNN first reported , out of the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg. \"Need to blow this place up,\" one commenter posted on the \"Heart of Texas\" page, referring to the Islamic center. \"We don't need this s--- in Texas.\"\n\nHow technology changed the game\n\nWhat divides the era of Agayants and the era of Putin is technological innovation.\n\nA lot of work went into the swastika graffiti operation: months of logistical planning, a dress rehearsal in a Soviet village, the recruiting and training and financing of just the right East German operatives who would then wend their way into established West German neo-Nazi groups and carry out their mission. Compare that to the ease with which bogus Facebook or Twitter accounts were set up or a duplicitous advertisement was bought.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nFor good reason did Andrey Krutskikh, a senior advisor to the Kremlin, liken Russia's latter-day information warfare capability to the testing of the Soviet atom bomb. If nothing else, he and his cohort have given the lie to the utopian conceit that the Internet would necessarily be a force for greater democratization and the broadening of political horizons.\n\nIn fact, \"connectivity\" has only further ghettoized politics, and served as a useful playground for vicious authoritarians as often as it has a vital medium for revolutionaries. Here, too, the heirs of the KGB have only exploited human nature. What Alexander Herzen, the great 19th-century Russian liberal, said he feared most for the future was \"Genghis Khan with the telegraph.\"",

                  "TEXT": "(CNN) Threats, bribes and stuffed ballot boxes may sound like a political drama, but these are all real issues that Africans face during national elections, a public opinion study has revealed.\n\nThe results, published by pan-African research institute Afrobarometer paint a dire picture of trust in the democratic process on the continent, where less than half (44%) of people across the 36 countries surveyed say they trust their national electoral commission only somewhat or a lot.\n\nPeople in countries with upcoming elections, or who have had elections recently, expressed some of the lowest levels of trust, says lead author Peter Penar, a researcher and lecturer in political science at Michigan State University.\n\n'Alarming numbers'\n\nTake Gabon for example, which has seen post election protests and unrest this month after opposition leader Jean Ping lost by less than 6,000 votes.\n\nThere, 51% have no trust at all in their election commission, and a mere 25% say they trust them a lot or somewhat.\n\n\"Those are all very alarming numbers and, it shows an extreme lack of confidence,\" Penar says.\n\nThe survey was based on face-to-face interviews with between 1,200 and 2,400 people in each of the 36 countries.\n\nWhile individuals' responses are not published, the researchers have identified a number of key factors contributing to the lack of trust.\n\nA checkered history\n\nA history of vote manipulation entrenched in people's memories, lack of transparency of election monitoring bodies and corruption all influence people's trust in the system and many are afraid when casting their vote, the researchers found.\n\nBut what worries people the most is the counting of votes, Penar says, with 38% of Africans believing votes are only sometimes, or even never counted.\n\nVote counts can be tampered with in many ways, according to Penar.\n\n\"[This happens] at the polling stations. Stuffing ballots, double voting, multiple voting.\"\n\nMethods for swaying voters may also include threats, actual violence and bribery.\n\nHow much for your vote?\n\nBribery is commonplace in some countries, the study showed.\n\nThe practice is illegal, and so rather than asking people whether they have accepted bribes, researchers posed the more indirect question of how often people in the country face bribery around election time.\n\nOn average, 43% of Africans said people are often or always bribed, with nearly 70% saying voters were bribed at least sometimes.\n\nSome countries returned startlingly high numbers. In Mali, 78% of people said voters were often or always bribed, and in Senegal the figure was 68%.\n\nThe bribes may range from giving a little money at the polling stations to being offered seeds or medicines during campaigns, Penar says.\n\nThreats of violence at the polls\n\nVoter intimidation is also key, the researchers found, with 44% of those surveyed saying they are sometimes, often or always threatened with violence when voting.\n\n\"That's incredibly high,\" says Penar.\n\n\"This makes people afraid of going to the polls and expressing an autonomous and personal choice of who they want to win.\"\n\nSurprising findings\n\nAmong the most surprising findings, according to Penar, was the lack of trust in Ghana, which goes to the polls in December this year.\n\n\"We think of Ghana as a country that's really improved in terms of electoral competition and having alternation of power.\"\n\nStill, 37% of Ghanaians say they don't trust the national electoral commission at all.\n\nThe picture looks different across the Atlantic. A 2016 Pew study showed that 78% of US citizens are confident, or very confident, that their vote will be counted fairly in the upcoming election.\n\nIn Africa, the Afrobarometer study showed that an average 54% across the 36 countries believe that, votes are often or always counted fairly in their country.\n\nCan digital save the day?\n\nNew digital tools such as using fingerprints and digital imaging to identify voters is changing the way elections are run in Africa, which may improve the process in the future.\n\nSouth African voters having their ID checked digitally at a polling station\n\nIn Namibia, a new system appears to have boosted voters' trust, Penar says.\n\n\"Namibia has invested in an electronic voting system. Interestingly one of the best countries in terms of trust in their election commission is Namibia, at 74%.\"\n\nBut while new digital tools can make it harder to tamper with votes, they can also create problems as they require electricity and technical know-how at the polling stations, something not to be taken for granted in rural areas, Penar adds.\n\nAnd while election processes could be improved by storing and counting votes digitally, issues with corruption may remain.\n\n\"The servers on which the results data is stored may be owned by a friend of the president or a relative of an election commission. That happens.\"",

                  "TEXT": "(CNN) A man who was blinded in one eye by a foul ball during a game at Wrigley Field is suing Major League Baseball and the Chicago Cubs.\n\n\"I am trying to protect others from going through what I and my family are going through,\" John Loos said at a news conference in Chicago on Monday.\n\nDuring a Chicago Cubs-Pittsburgh Pirates game on August 29, Loos was hit by a ball traveling at high speed. The incident left him blind in his left eye he said. The vision loss may be permanent and he might need a prosthetic eye, he added.\n\n\"I haven't done much since August 29 ... I am on short term disability. I'm not sure when I will be able to return to work,\" said Loos, 60, who works in information technology management and lives in the Chicago area.\n\nAt Wrigley Field, safety netting does not extend to the far ends of the dugout.\n\nThe lawsuit (PDF), filed last week, references a 2014 Bloomberg report stating more than 1,700 fans are injured each year by baseballs entering the stands at a high rate of speed. \"The most dangerous areas are the exposed areas along the first and third baselines in foul territory,\" the lawsuit said. \"In these hot zones, there is no netting and the patrons are exposed.\" Loos was sitting in such an area when he was struck by the baseball.\n\nAttorney Colin Dunn, who represents Loos, said they are not seeking a particular sum of money at this point. \"The lawsuit is seeking more than $50,000 but that's a jurisdictional requirement for Cook County,\" he said.\n\nIn an email to CNN, Cubs' Vice President of Communications, Julian Green said the organization hasn't seen the lawsuit. \"If and when we do, we don't typically comment on pending lawsuits.\"\n\nMajor League Baseball did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\n\nLoos has had multiple surgeries since the accident. He also suffered five broken bones on his face and has a hole in his sinus which bleeds into his mouth, he told reporters.\n\nHe said he will need to undergo two more surgeries and has contemplated removing his injured eye.\n\nDunn said it's not just fans who are worried.\n\n\"There are players in Major League Baseball who will not let their families sit in unprotected areas,\" he said. \"In 2007, 2012, as part of the Collective Bargaining Agreement negotiations, one of the asks by the player was to extend the netting. They know how dangerous it is,\" he added.\n\nTickets purchased for a Major League Baseball game state the risk of being hit by a foul ball, limiting the team's liability -- but Loos says he was at the game as a guest and didn't purchase a ticket.\n\n\"I was told my seat was a good one ... I have been only to a few games and to sit so close to the field with my family was really exciting for me,\" said Loos.\n\nIn the fifth inning, a foul ball came off the bat and hit him the face. He felt a rush of pain and lost sight in that eye immediately, he said.\n\nHis son, who was sitting next to him, saw the ball coming but had no time to warn him.\n\n\"I had no chance to avoid it. It was just too fast,\" Loos recalled.\n\nPrior to the accident, Loos had 20/20 vision, he said.\n\nTell us your story Tell us your story\n\nWe love to hear from our audience. Follow @CNNHealth on Twitter and Facebook for the latest health news and let us know what we're missing.\n\nIn September a child was injured by a foul ball at Yankee stadium in New York. In response MLB commissioner Rob Manfred called the incident \"extremely upsetting.\" In a statement he said, \"over the past few seasons MLB has worked with our clubs to expand the amount of netting in our ballparks...we will redouble our efforts on this important issue.\"\n\nSince then teams including the New York Yankees, New York Mets, Cincinnati Reds, Colorado Rockies and the San Diego Padres have all announced plans to install additional netting at their stadiums.\n\n\"My life and the lives of many fans have been changed forever by Major League Baseball's failure to protect its fans. It's too late for me, but Major League Baseball must fix this not after the playoffs, not next year but now,\" said Loos.\n\nLoos' lawyers said he had reached out to the Cubs before the case was filed last week.\n\n\"They told us that they are willing to talk to us,\" Dunn said. \"I take that in good faith. I do think they care about their fans.\"",

                  "TEXT": "Jeffrey Thomas is a New Orleans-based attorney with the law firm Cara Stone LLP who specializes in helping communities with post-disaster recovery and climate change adaptation. Jeffrey previously served as special assistant in the city of New Orleans' post-Katrina Office of Recovery & Development. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) As Hurricane Nate swept over Louisiana's coast, the flooding that Mother Nature brought to New Orleans with watery, improbable fury earlier this summer was still on the minds of the people who live in the city. Three unnamed rainstorms in as many weeks fell in America's shining city in a bowl. The last one, on August 5 -- a near \"100-year storm\" -- dropped more than 8 inches of rain in a matter of hours. It overwhelmed a less than functioning drainage system, exposed local government's limits to respond, and flooded neighborhoods to levels not seen since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nOnlookers could be excused for thinking the combination of severe weather and man-made failings was just another ill-advised concoction served up uniquely in the \" city care forgot. \" But then Harvey met Houston; and Irma visited Miami, Jacksonville and Charleston; and Jose discovered Norfolk and Long Island.\n\nNationwide, the United States sustained 19 major floods just in 2016. This is the most since that stat began to be tracked in 1980, according to USA Today. That 2016 tally includes at least three \"1,000-year\" storm events. Indeed, according to the National Weather Service, between August 2015 and August 2016, American communities have sustained over eight rain events exceeding 500-year severity (0.02% change occurring annually), including three alone in Houston\n\nThe watery woes of American cities are also not just coming from the sky. With seas along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts rising on average over 0.13 inches annually over the past 20 years, nuisance \"sunny day\" flooding is rising exponentially. Cities such as Atlantic City, Annapolis, Baltimore, Charleston, Miami, Norfolk, and Philadelphia are witnessing a five- to tenfold increase in tidal floods exceeding a foot or more. That is enough water to disrupt businesses, swamp homes, compromise drainage systems -- and discourage new households and investors.\n\nNew Orleans and other US cities wading through chronic floods are the canaries in the coal mine. They are signposts for countless communities that face the specter of their own recurring natural hazards made unfathomable by climate change. The successful response to look for and emulate is not merely acknowledging changes afoot but also putting forth policy courage and innovation to retool municipal government in order to adapt and mitigate.\n\nNot operating at full capacity on August 5\n\nOn August 5, a seemingly routine summer thunderstorm transformed quickly into a stationary monsoon and overwhelmed New Orleans' infrastructure and ability to anticipate and respond. It was a storm straight from the climate change playbook -- above average heat content in the air and nearby seas giving rise to even more copious rains in a region already the rainiest in the United States.\n\nNew Orleans exists on the shoulders of 120 active drainage pumps nestled in a basin lying, on average, 6 feet below sea level and surrounded by water. These century-old behemoths , powered mostly by similarly ancient electric turbines, work against gravity to move water through over 1,700 miles of pipes, bus-width underground culverts, and open canals. At optimal capacity, city officials believe the system can prevent most flooding from rains falling up to 1 inch for an hour and then half an inch per hour after that.\n\nBut August 5 was less than optimal. While a certain amount of flooding was to be expected given the volume of rain, at least 16 pumps and three of five electrical turbines were offline for repairs. In some of the lowest lying neighborhoods, draining capacity was just above 50% during the storm. In all, it took over 14 hours to drain the city and hundreds of homes, businesses and vehicles were flooded, resulting in over 800 flood insurance flood claims to date.\n\nThis infrastructure failure was exacerbated by failures to adequately communicate the risk afoot to the public and among the multiple agencies that coordinate disaster preparation and response. With turbines and pumps offline in some cases for months or longer, local officials seemingly could not anticipate nor convey publicly the impact that might have amid severe storms. Indeed, as the rains fell, public assurances promised that pumps were running at capacity, a position later revealed to be classic bureaucratic rhetoric: \"max capacity\" apparently meant working at the \"capacity they had available to them.\"\n\nNew Orleans is sinking\n\nMaking matters worse, New Orleans and its drainage system are sinking. At a rate of over 8 millimeters per year -- in some areas over 10 feet in the last century -- New Orleans' foundation of ancient Mississippi river clay and organic matter is compacting, ironically, because not enough rainwater is allowed to absorb into the soil. Amid worsening rainstorms, the impact of this is that the more the city sinks, the more the pipes break and the more New Orleans floods. Rinse and repeat. Of course, New Orleans is not alone in grappling with a confounding trifecta of copious rain, rising seas, and sinking lands. Houston, Norfolk , Miami, and many other US coastal cities face this same dilemma that compounds worsening storms and further warrants the need to reinvent urban build environments to survive.\n\nAdapting communities to be more resilient to climate change and natural disasters\n\nNo city is disaster-proof or immune to deteriorating infrastructure, policy shortsightedness, or bureaucratic disconnects. Wisely then we should all be pondering what could be done to be safer next time. The buzzword is resilience. The solution is figuring out how to adapt local infrastructure, land use, public funds, and public-private communications to be a step ahead of intensifying and recurring natural disasters.\n\nMuch of the public infrastructure and land use policy within vulnerable US cities is incompatible with addressing climate change and disaster resilience needs. For example, customary \"hard\" infrastructure such as levees, sea walls, and pumps are mostly effective at walling off water and moving it out of an area. However, such assets offer very little toward slowing subsidence or creating buffers between people and floods that also add aesthetic and recreational value.\n\nA more sustainable approach also enlists a city's curbs, medians, parking lots, parks and waterfronts in the service of flood protection. \"Green infrastructure,\" including rain gardens, retention ponds, permeable surfacing and larger-scale natural areas, can absorb water to slow subsidence and runoff, create new park spaces, and sponge up contaminants for good measure. New Orleans, Atlanta, New York Philadelphia , and Prince Georges County (Maryland), among others, are making impressive strides toward city-scale green infrastructure plans. Elsewhere, among communities rebuilding in the Houston area, reintroducing more natural barriers separating homes from water is a priority. Indeed, 1 acre of restored Houston prairie grass can soak up the runoff created by 2 acres of adjacent single-family homes or 1 acre of commercial property.\n\nComparable natural protection potential exists for any city built around watersheds or coastlines. The opportunity ahead for American cities is to craft long-term infrastructure investment and land use strategies that not only re-establish natural defenses in urbanized areas, but also maintain community cohesion by working with relocating households to find -- or even collaborate together to create -- safer nearby neighborhoods or communities.\n\nStill, implementing such innovative concepts continues to run into outdated local governance norms for investing in public infrastructure, including municipal bond issuances that do not easily quantify disaster resilience as a calculable return on investment and political resistance to consolidating design, build, and maintenance contracting, which can lure p rivate investment into public projects but risks reducing overall contracting opportunities and creating new user fees.\n\nStatus-quo urban land use policy is also increasingly challenged with every flood, revealing the true identity of many neighborhoods and subdivisions. They are floodplains masquerading as higher enclaves.\n\nFor example, in the Houston metropolitan area there are over 140,000 single-home residences in regulated floodplains, UPI reports, citing the flood control district website, spurred along by a population increase of over 70% in that area's \"100-year\" floodplain between 2000 and 2010. Upstream of Houston during Harvey, the 26,000-acre Addicks and Barker Reservoirs, built from ranchland in the 1930s to prevent floodwaters from careening into Houston, filled completely for the first time and had to be opened, causing flooding to thousands living nearby. That was a hardship exacerbated by decades of land use policies enabling community building where waters lay.\n\nThis is not just Houston's tale. Since 1993, over $3 billion in federal funding has been used for the voluntary buyout of over 38,000 floodplain properties nationwide, including more than 1,500 homes in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut after Hurricanes Irene and Sandy. Tellingly, though, over that same period (not including 2017), the National Flood Insurance Program paid out over $52 billion in flood claims, according to FEMA. That's a coalmine canary in need of a new tune.\n\nFederal disaster funding is upside-down\n\nIn the United States today, the surest means for cities to fund large-scale investments in climate change and disaster resilience requires first suffering a natural disaster. At present, few, if any, federal, state or local public funds match the federal monies awarded after a federally declared disaster in terms of capacity to help improve a city's disaster resilience. This is an upside-down paradigm. Public Assistance Grants and Hazard Mitigation Grants (HMGP) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and disaster-recovery Community Development Block Grants (CDBG-DR) from the US Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) can provide disaster-impacted state and local governments with hundreds of millions of dollars or more to build infrastructure, businesses and homes.\n\nThe problem is obvious when you look at federal funding in advance of disasters. By comparison, FEMA's smaller pre-disaster HMGP program is slated for budget cuts and the other main pre-disaster federal source of community development funding -- HUD's CDBG program -- has been proposed for outright elimination.\n\nFor cities seeking to invest in their future disaster resilience, the idea is not to have to rely on after-the-fact, one-time federal monies. In New Orleans, hundreds of millions of dollars is being invested in upgrades to the city's pump-turbine system and towards neighborhood-scale green infrastructure projects. All of it is federal funding received after Katrina and successive hurricanes.\n\nElsewhere, HUD recently conducted a National Disaster Resilience Competition in which 67 state and local governments, all of which sustained at least one disaster since 2012, competed for a portion of $1 billion in funding for proactive disaster resilience projects. There were over $7 billion worth of submitted proposals.\n\nGive homeowners and businesses tools for smart choices\n\nNew Orleans and other communities would benefit from the public sector sharing adequate tools by which homeowners and businesses can gauge their own risk, i.e. providing full information to enable market-driven decisions. For example, in New Orleans, real-time data and mapping of stormwater flows, pump capacity, and other metrics remain the wonky providence of watershed managers and emergency planners. The private sector and general citizenry are still largely relegated to conveying flood risk via sobering oral histories that describe past neighborhood flood events.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nLooking ahead, lessons learned from the watery tales of New Orleans, Houston and other vulnerable communities can benefit all Americans. Climate change in all its wild and diverse permutations will increasingly challenge the future of America's coastal cities. New Orleans, and its like kind, are but front row opportunities to witness how countless communities will rise up to redefine how they govern, build and thrive to meet that challenge -- or not.",

                  "TEXT": "Douglas Heye is a CNN political commentator and former deputy chief of staff to then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(CNN) Shortly after Wednesday morning's attack on Republican members of Congress practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game, Congressman Rodney Davis, still in his baseball clothes, spoke to CNN's Brianna Keilar.\n\nIn addition to describing the events he witnessed, he spoke from the heart.\n\n\"This hatefulness that we see in this country today over policy differences has got to stop ... Republicans and Democrats need to use this day today to stand together and say 'stop.' Let's work together. Let's get things done,\" he said. \"We can have our differences, but let's not let it lead to such hate.\"\n\nWe should all heed Congressman Davis' call, including our President. Since his announcement to run for office, Donald Trump has consistently yelled fire in a crowded political theater by castigating various segments of our population and encouraging his supporters to \" knock the crap \" out of protesters. And on and on.\n\nMany Donald Trump supporters have followed his lead, escalating the rhetoric against political opponents and the media. A reporter was choke-slammed in Montana. And before Trump, too many Republicans engaged in awful and, let's face it, racist attacks on President Obama. Perhaps even worse, too many Republicans watched this happen and remained silent.\n\nMeanwhile, town halls, opportunities that should allow for a respectful dialogue between elected officials and voters, have become opposition events where silencing and jeering the politician has become the norm.\n\nPresident Trump holds the world's largest microphone and therefore can do the most to quell much of the angry rhetoric we've seen.\n\nBut it doesn't end with our President. Since he was elected, many Democrats have continually upped the ante to out-resist each other in opposition to President Trump. Their behavior has created an environment where Democratic lawmakers routinely stoop to foul language in public events. It's also a climate where a comedian and a theater company feel it's somehow acceptable to post gruesome pictures of a decapitated president or stage a Shakespeare classic to envision the assassination of a politician who bears a strong resemblance to Donald Trump.\n\nAnd in this case, where the shooter appears to have been a volunteer for Bernie Sanders, Democrats too have some soul-searching to do. Senator Sanders has strongly condemned the suspect, and he is right that \"violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\"\n\nThese things accumulate, which means they inevitably escalate. And whether the targets are Republican members of Congress, like today, or Democratic politicians or members of the media, it was perhaps inescapable that something tragic was coming in an environment like this.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nPolitics is a business with a lot of tough talk where contrasts and distinctions are constantly drawn. Negative ads have become an artform. But what we've seen in recent years is different. Increasingly, we question not just the judgment of those we disagree with, but each others' motives and legitimacy.\n\nOn the far ends of the political spectrum, invective and hate -- or a blind \"us versus them\" tribal mentality -- stand above reason and debate. Those voices gain prominence and followers as the media incentivize them to go further by giving them airtime and clicks.\n\nOur nation faces many challenges, but healing our divisions may be our biggest one. More than Obamacare, tax reform, ISIS or our national debt, this rhetoric, and the divisions it causes, directly constrains our ability to tackle other issues.",

                  "TEXT": "Jen Psaki, a CNN political commentator and spring fellow at the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service, was the White House communications director and State Department spokeswoman during the Obama administration. She also was a consultant for Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Follow her: @jrpsaki. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers\n\nThey typically include scripted remarks, and they last for about 24 hours -- or less. Just a few minutes into his speech at a rally in Phoenix Tuesday evening , the clock ran out. And it quickly went off the rails.\n\nIt wasn't just a speech lacking structure, or focus, or message. It was an unhinged rant from someone who is supposed to be leading our country and bringing us back together after one of the toughest weeks of his presidency\n\nIf the goal was to fire up his base and throw red meat -- ranging from attacks on the media to a threat to shut down the government over building a transparent border wall to a wink and a nod about pardoning the divisive ex-Sheriff Joseph Arpaio, a man who was still a birther even after Trump had stopped making the claim -- well, they got that job done. But for what?\n\nEven with a slight dip among Republicans in some recent polls , President Trump's biggest challenge is not to fire up his base or to worry about his re-election campaign in 2020.\n\nHe has no legislative legacy-building accomplishments under his belt -- beyond his former friend Sen. Mitch McConnell successfully pushing through Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court . And for the first time in modern American history, there are legitimate questions, prompted by no one other than Donald Trump himself, about whether the President of the United States sympathizes with white supremacists.\n\nThe words President Trump used in his Afghanistan speech on Monday night were a dramatic improvement from last week (putting aside the fact that no President in modern history has ever felt the need to begin a prime-time address by disavowing racism because the country he leads had doubts.) Still, at Fort Myer on Monday, Trump appealed to the country to be unified.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump: Our movement is built on love Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Our movement is built on love 00:51\n\nThat was never going to mend the hurt and anger from the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, because words alone rarely do, and they didn't even calm the fears many people in the country have about the sitting President's racial bias -- because we know Trump well enough now to know that a one-off set of scripted remarks rarely represents his overall point of view and thinking. But it was a small step in the right direction.\n\nNo surprise he took a flying leap in the other direction in Phoenix on Tuesday night, and delivered a speech that was all about division.\n\nHe spent several excruciating minutes reading from his own statements of last week and defending them. It was the media's fault -- not Donald Trump's, he said. It was as if he was not aware that there is a record, a well documented one, of what was said last week, when he suggested that there was fault on \"many sides\" for the violence and that there were \"very fine people\" associated with the white supremacists as well as the counter-protesters.\n\nAnd because that wasn't enough -- and because alienating the African-American community last week was not enough -- he decided to raise the possibility of pardoning former Sheriff Arpaio, a man who has been accused of racially profiling Latinos.\n\nI am not a Trump supporter. But I found myself rooting for him at the beginning of the speech to read the teleprompter, to stick with the message of unity, to swallow his bile and recognize as a human being that this moment required something bigger than he typically was capable of delivering.\n\nInstead, my jaw was on the floor, like many people watching. I guess I should stop being so surprised.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) The decision by the United States to suspend the processing of visas for Turkish citizens following the arrest of a US Consulate employee looks set to escalate if media reports that Turkish authorities have issued an arrest warrant for another consular official turn out to be true.\n\nThis deterioration of relations between the United States and Turkey should come as no great surprise. It follows a decline in friendliness that has gradually worsened over the last few years on a number of issues.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's requests for the US military to end its cooperation with the Kurdistan Workers' Party-affiliated Syrian Kurdish fighters have fallen on deaf ears. He has publicly berated the Pentagon for supplying arms to a group seeking to establish an autonomous Kurdish entity in northern Syria along the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\nThen there is the complex issue of US reluctance -- in Ankara's eyes -- to extradite the Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen , who it alleges played a crucial role in the failed coup plot in June 2016. The US government justifies its position by retorting that Turkey has failed to provide sufficient evidence of his involvement to initiate the legal process for extradition in American courts -- as required by the 1979 US-Turkey extradition treaty.\n\nThe United States perceives Turkey's detention of US pastor Andrew Brunson and willingness to swap him for Gulen as unfair and illegal.\n\nInterestingly, Erdogan is not relying on the extradition treaty but on powers he granted himself under emergency rule to exchange detained foreigners for Turks imprisoned abroad.\n\nHe is also angry at the United States for arresting a Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab and issuing a criminal indictment against a former Turkish minister, Mehmet Zafer Caglayan, over allegedly bypassing US financial sanctions against Iran by facilitating gold-for-oil trade via Turkey.\n\nJUST WATCHED Who is Fethullah Gulen? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Who is Fethullah Gulen? 03:56\n\nIn response to this decline in relations between the two allies, Turkey has purchased Russia's S-400 missile system despite it being incompatible with NATO systems, and is coordinating Syria policy closely with both Moscow and Tehran.\n\nHowever, Russia will not have forgotten that a Turkish F-16 fighter jet shot down a Russian SU-24 near the Turkish-Syrian border not so long ago. Equally, Tehran will be well aware of Erdogan's once-unstoppable determination to dislodge its erstwhile friend, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIn other words, Russia's and Iran's dalliance with Turkey is purely transactional and short term. Only a few years ago, Turkey was coordinating its Syria strategy with the United States in the forlorn hope of deepening US military intervention there. Once heightened expectations are frustrated, Erdogan tends to gyrate to the opposing camp out of anger and disappointment.\n\nGiven Turkey's geostrategic position and historical partnership with the United States, it should adopt a more flexible and sober approach that balances relations with Washington and Moscow. By shifting between Russia and the West, Turkey portrays itself unnecessarily as a volatile and challenging counterpart. That image does Turkey no favors in the turbulent Middle East and undermines its reliability with friends and allies.\n\nMoreover, Turkey's perennial dependence on huge external capital flows from Western financial markets to fund its economic prosperity should be reason enough for it to reign in its recent disagreeability with the United States and European countries such as Germany.\n\nAfter all, the Turkish economy will be significantly damaged if Ankara's current foreign policy trajectory persists.\n\nUltimately, Erdogan's fight with the United States is a lose-lose to both parties, but probably more so in the longer term to Turkey.",

The NFL is doing the hard work of trying to move from protest to progress, working to bring people together....Players from around the league will be in New York next week to meet with owners to continue our work together.\"\n\nNFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said that Wednesday's statement \"isn't just about the President,\" and that it also referred to inaccurate news reports about a letter Goodell sent to the teams on Tuesday.\n\nRelated: Trump's grievances with the NFL goes way back\n\nIn his letter Tuesday, Goodell vowed to \"continue the unprecedented dialogue with our players.\" He did not make any threat of disciplinary action against players who take a knee or sit during the playing of the National Anthem. His letter certainly did not vow to cut, ban, bench or \"fire\" any players who join the protest, as Trump has advocated.\n\nTrump's call to fire players who protest during the anthem has only prompted an increase in the number of players who now kneel or otherwise protest during the playing of the Star Spangled Banner.

                  "TEXT": "As parents, we have many hopes for our kids. We want them to grow up to live happy, successful lives. We hope they'll find love, maybe have kids of their own, and pursue their dreams. But at the bottom of all these wishes is the hope that our kid turns into a decent human being -- someone who is kind, respectful, and honest.\n\nHow do you bolster these strengths as well as teach key skills such as teamwork, communication, and perseverance? For the most part, kids will learn these things by following your example and through experience gained at school and in their communities. But media is another entry point. Since movies, TV shows, books, video games, and social media are such a huge part of kids' lives, it makes sense that kids can learn important lessons about character through media.\n\nHere are some specific things you can do or say to reinforce character:\n\nWatch sports.\n\nNot only can watching sports with kids be a really fun way to bond over a favorite team or player, it can be a perfect opportunity to point out character strengths from teamwork to perseverance. After cheering over a big touchdown or basket, point out how important the linebackers or passers were to the score: Even though they don't get all the attention, the team wouldn't be successful without the admirable work of supporting players.\n\nShare social media.\n\nFrom Facebook and Instagram to YouTube, social media is ripe with character lessons. If you notice a post, photo, or video of something especially touching or beautiful, share it with your kid and comment on how much courage it took for the poster to share their story or creative expression.\n\nDiscuss the risks involved with putting yourself out there and how important it is to take (reasonable) risks to be true to yourself, even though you might face criticism.\n\nExpand your horizons.\n\nWatching documentaries or movies about people who live very different lives can trigger empathy, compassion, and humility. During a family movie night, choose something out of the ordinary -- a story about someone of a different race or religion, or about a community that's less fortunate than yours, or a subculture with different values or beliefs than yours -- and encourage discussion afterward.\n\nPlay video games together.\n\nGaming as a family offers the chance to practice teamwork, problem-solving, communication, and perseverance, while also having fun. Choose multiplayer games where gamers are required to work together to win. Model positive, respectful communication during the game (try \"I need help over here\" instead of \"you idiot!\"). If kids are trying over and over again to achieve a game goal, you can recognize their effort as well as their success.\n\nTake a time-out.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nMost households are abuzz as various mobile devices alert us to text messages or Instagram posts. But we can help teach our kids self-control by resisting the urge to respond immediately. Next time you hear a text message alert (and you know it's nothing urgent), say out loud, \"I don't need to check that right now.\" This lesson can work on social media, too. If you're a Twitter or Facebook user and you see something that makes you mad, talk through with your kid why you don't want to respond right away (\"I might say something I regret because I'm upset\" or \"I'd rather tell my friend that this bothers me privately instead of publicly on Twitter\").",

                  "TEXT": "(CNN) In what is perhaps the fiercest and the most exhaustive attack against Donald Trump in hip-hop, Eminem \"came to stomp\" Tuesday night, calling the President everything from \"Donald the b----\" to a \"racist grandpa\" in an explosive 4.5-minute freestyle rap.\n\nThe Detroit rapper challenged his fans at the BET Hip Hop Awards to \"decide who you like more\" -- Eminem or Trump. He has slammed the President previously in the nine-minute 2016 freestyle \"Campaign Speech\" and in Big Sean's \"No Favors.\"\n\n\"And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his, I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against, and if you can't decide who you like more and you're split on who you should stand beside, I'll do it for it for you with this. F--- you,\" he said toward the end, raising his middle finger.\n\nA request to the White House for comment was not immediately returned.\n\nThe latest freestyle, which Eminem revealed on Twitter is called \"The Storm,\" comes as anticipation for Eminem's eighth studio release builds. The rapper decried Trump's comments following the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, questioned the President's own patriotism following his attacks on athletes and Sen. John McCain, and in closing, issued a passionate tribute to Colin Kaepernick.\n\n\"I appreciate you @Eminem,\" Kaepernick tweeted, along with a fist emoji.\n\nThe former San Francisco 49ers quarterback is now a free agent after he rose to national prominence last fall when he refused to stand for the national anthem to protest police brutality. Eminem previously expressed his support for Kaepernick in \"Campaign Speech.\"\n\nHere are the 11 most explosive lines from his newest anti-Trump freestyle in the order that they appear:\n\n1) 'A kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust'\n\nHere's the full verse: \"We better give Obama props 'cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust while the drama pops, and he waits for s--- to quiet down, he'll just gas his plane up and fly around till the bombing stops.\"\n\nHere, Eminem is likely referencing Trump's war of words on social media with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, whom the President referred to as \"little rocket man.\"\n\n2) 'Trump, when it comes to giving a s--- you're stingy as I am'\n\nThis line comes after Eminem references rising tensions in America.\n\n3) 'Racism's the only thing he's Fantastic 4 cause that's how he gets his rock off, he's orange'\n\n4) 'Cause he cannot withstand the fact we're not afraid of Trump'\n\nHere's the full verse: \"That's why he wants us to disband cause he cannot withstand the fact we're not afraid of Trump. Walking on egg shells, I came to stomp. That's why he keeps screaming, 'Drain the swamp,' cause he's in quicksand.\"\n\nHere, Eminem criticizes those who have been tepid when it comes to expressing their opposition to the President.\n\n5) 'All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm'\n\n\"But this is his form of distraction, plus he gets an enormous reaction when he attacks the NFL, so we focus on that instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada. All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm with the Packers.\"\n\nHere, the rapper slams the President for spending days attacking NFL players who take a knee and escalating the feud as a hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico and a massacre occurred in Nevada. Trump visited both Puerto Rico and Las Vegas following each disaster.\n\n6) 'Who's going to pay for his extravagant trips'\n\nFull verse: \"He says he wants to lower our taxes, then who's going to play for his extravagant trips back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?\"\n\nLast month Trump unveiled a Republican framework for tax reform that calls for sweeping tax cuts and a simplification of the tax code.\n\n7) 'Same shit that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more'\n\nFull verse: \"Same shit that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more. From his endorsement of Bannon, support for the Klansman, tiki torches in hand for the solider that's black and comes home from Iraq and is still told to go back to Africa.\"\n\nHere, Eminem is referring to Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who is also the executive chairman of the conservative media outlet Breitbart News.\n\n8) 'This racist 94-year old grandpa'\n\nThis line comes before the rapper says Trump is ignoring America's racist past.\n\n9) 'To him, you're zero cause he don't like his war heroes captured'\n\n\"He says you're spitting in the face of vets who fought for us you b-------, Unless you're a POW who's tortured ... cause to him you're zero cause he don't like his war heroes captured. That's not disrespecting the military.\"\n\nEminem accuses the President of disrespecting the military -- a charge that Trump recently leveled against athletes who take a knee during the national anthem. In this lyric, he references Trump's previous attacks on Arizona Sen. John McCain, who spent five years as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. In 2015, Trump questioned whether McCain is a war hero, saying, \"I like people that weren't captured, OK?\"\n\n10) 'F--- that, this is for Colin, ball up a fist and keep that s--- balled like Donald the b----'\n\nYou can check out hip-hop's strongest lyrics on Kaepernick HERE.",

                  "TEXT": "(CNN) There is really just one salient question when it comes to today's decision by the Drug Enforcement Administration to expand the number of growers of research-grade marijuana, while still not changing the scheduling of marijuana: Will this decision make it significantly easier for scientists to study the medical benefits of marijuana?\n\nThe answer sadly is: unlikely. And this is a missed opportunity that could further delay potential therapies to countless people.\n\nUp until today, the University of Mississippi has been the only federally approved source of research-grade medical marijuana in the United States. In a bit of seemingly positive news today, the DEA also announced it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same. The hope is that marijuana available for scientific study could grow in both amount and diversity.\n\nWhile this will be hailed as a victory for research, it will largely be symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access is still difficult, it hardly matters.\n\nImagine a product that is in high demand but kept behind a locked door. In response to the demand for the product, someone makes a baffling decision to make more of it but still never unlocks the door.\n\nMarijuana is that product, and its Schedule I designation is that locked door.\n\nThat is the predicament of medical marijuana.\n\nBecause marijuana is a Schedule I substance (meaning that by definition it has \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse\"), there are significant hurdles to getting the door unlocked.\n\nPotential researchers typically go to the DEA first, as it grants the license to begin scientific research. Even if a license is granted, to study a Schedule I substance , institutions must have heavy-duty safes and high-grade security systems installed, which can be expensive. There is also the more subjective consideration of getting approval from your academic institution to do the research on a Schedule I status substance in the first place. Even if individual faculty members want to do that research, the university leadership may not want the hassle or the potential fallout of bad press. This happened at the University of Arizona when Dr. Sue Sisley was let go after trying to pursue a medical marijuana trial.\n\nSisley eventually had to find private funding for her project, and just in April, seven years after the study was initially proposed, hers became the first DEA approved medical marijuana trial for post-traumatic stress in veterans.\n\nThen, after years of those bureaucratic hurdles, it is the National Institute on Drug Abuse that has held the final key to the lock. Today, it is the biggest federal public funder of marijuana research and has been the sole supplier of the marijuana itself. Even if more medical marijuana will now be freed up for research, the institute will still have to approve any studies it funds.\n\nThe problem, however, is that last word in NIDA's name: \"abuse.\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Donald Abrams at the University of San Francisco, whom I interviewed for my documentary \"Weed,\" the institute has a primary mandate to study substances for potential abuse rather than as a medicine. Abrams makes an important point. Even if a study does cross all the hurdles described above, the door may stay locked if the intent is to study the benefits of medical marijuana as opposed to the harm.\n\nConsider this: A quick (and admittedly non-scientific) search through the U.S. National Library of Medicine pulled up 1,434 papers on medical marijuana over the past five years. That same search revealed only 57 papers on medical marijuana benefits. The vast majority were research into the harm of marijuana, such as \"Bad trip due to anticholinergic effect of cannabis,\" \"Cannabis induced pancreatitits\" and \"Marijuana use and risk of lung cancer.\" That imbalance paints a highly distorted picture of the harm-benefit ratio.\n\nContradictory policy\n\nThe road to medical marijuana research is paved with surprises and hypocrisy nearly everywhere you look.\n\nWhile the DEA continues to dig in on Schedule I status, deeming no medical benefit, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services simultaneously holds a patent on cannabinoids for a wide range of medicinal purposes.\n\nThe DEA continues to place marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as drugs with high abuse potential even though the DEA's own former chief administrative law judge, Francis Young, disagreed with this.\n\nThis is one of many quotes from his 1988 petition (PDF) to unschedule marijuana.\n\n\"In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume. For example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response. By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death. Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man. By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within the supervised routine of medical care.\"\n\nAgain, that was from a judge with the DEA itself. And yet nearly 30 years later, little has changed.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nWhether we realize it or not, we all accept a certain amount of hypocrisy in our daily lives. Maybe we don't always have the energy to call it out or we are too speechless and dumbfounded that no one else seems to have noticed.\n\nWith regard to the hypocrisy of federal medical marijuana policy, however, it is worth summoning the stamina to relentlessly present the facts. The lives of patients -- such as that of Charlotte Figi , whose seizures abated with the use of medical marijuana, and so many others -- depend on it.\n\nThat a plant could provide so much benefit and still remain behind these locked doors is worth speaking up about.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\nI had no idea what was happening at first when I was jolted out of bed Monday morning by frantic calls, texts, and posts. But soon, that word \"again\" kept ringing in my head. I thought back to the missed calls, frantic texts, and Facebook statuses from trapped friends... and I thought, it is happening again in Las Vegas.\n\nSixteen months ago, those posts were mine. \"Hiding in the bathroom. Can't find my friends,\" I wrote. And now at least 58 people are dead and over 500 injured in Las Vegas, after a shooting at a country music festival.\n\nAnd though over a year has passed since the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, where 49 people were killed, including my closest friend, this new horror from Las Vegas brought me back to that same sense of dread. I can feel the pain in survivors' stories. I ache with grief for the mothers and fathers awaiting word from their children. I can remember the wall-to-wall news coverage.\n\nI have tried to forget waiting for my best friend's name and photo to appear on a list of victims. Today, all those terrors are back.\n\nThe Orlando community is hurting today, for Las Vegas and for ourselves. A wound that had barely begun to heal has been ripped open and laid bare by a man apparently armed like a soldier. As it did so many months ago, gun violence is again tearing at the seams of the country -- and this is felt so acutely by those affected by the Pulse nightclub shooting.\n\nTo the people impacted in Las Vegas: we love you. I love you. If I have learned any lesson from the dark road to recovery from mass violence, it is that we all need love more than we would like to admit. Stand together. Link arms. Embrace. And know that while you begin the work of healing a deep wound, Orlando is standing with you.\n\nTo my friends and neighbors in Orlando, I urge you to engage in self-care. Take breaks from the coverage. Stop refreshing your Twitter feed for today. Visit a counselor. Surround yourself with the love and warmth that protected you the day after the shooting. Today is a day for fortifying your soul; our brothers and sisters in Las Vegas will need strong shoulders to lean on.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAnd to the country: get fed up. Demand that something be done to save our neighborhoods. When is it enough? When it is in your backyard? When you wake up to the frantic texts of fear? When it is your brother's photo haunting you from the TV screen? While this community heals, send your thoughts and prayers. And when you are done kneeling in prayer, stand up ready to fight. Just as I did last year, the people of Las Vegas need action now. They need change. They deserve a country where we rally to their sides and refuse to bow to hate.",

                  "TEXT": "(CNN) In a blow to Obamacare's controversial contraceptive mandate, employers may now have more leeway to withhold birth control coverage on religious grounds, according to new rules issued by the US Department of Health and Human Services on Friday.\n\nThe new rules continue the undermining of the Obamacare mandate that requires birth control be covered with no co-pay as a preventive service. This could impact many of the millions of women who now receive contraceptives at no cost under this provision.\n\nThe rules would let a broad range of employers -- including nonprofits, private firms and publicly traded companies -- stop offering contraceptives through their health insurance plans if they have a \"sincerely held religious or moral objection,\" senior agency officials said on a call about the implementation and enforcement of the new rules.\n\nHealth and Human Services officials said the new rule would have no impact on \"99.9% of women\" in the United States. It is basing that percentage on the 165 million women in America, many of whom are not in their child-bearing years.\n\nThe agency calculated that at most, 120,000 women would be affected: mainly those who work at the roughly 200 entities that have been involved in 50 or so lawsuits over birth control coverage.\n\nPolicy experts, however, argue that this could open the door to hundreds of employers dropping coverage. For instance, there are hundreds of Catholic hospitals, nursing homes and nonprofits that may want to stop providing contraceptives, said Tim Jost, emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law.\n\nFriday's action consists of two rules, according to a Health and Human Services statement: First, entitles that have \"sincerely held religious beliefs\" against providing contraceptives would no longer be required to do so. The second rule extends the same provision to organizations and small businesses that have objections \"on the basis of moral conviction which is not based in any particular religious belief.\"\n\nThe latest announcement builds upon an executive order in May claiming \"to protect and vigorously promote religious liberty\" by providing \"regulatory relief\" for organizations that object on religious grounds to Obamacare coverage requirements for certain health services, including contraception.\n\n\"We will never, ever stand for religious discrimination. Never, ever,\" President Donald Trump said at the time.\n\nA number of legal challenges to the new rules are brewing from groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Women's Law Center, the Center for Reproductive Rights and the office of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra.\n\nThe ACLU filed a lawsuit Friday. The organization's senior staff attorney Brigitte Amiri called the administration's rules \"blatantly unconstitutional.\"\n\nUntil now, a fairly limited number of employers -- mainly churches and some other religious entities -- could get an exemption to the mandate. Some others, such as religious-based universities or hospitals, could seek accommodations so that they didn't have to provide coverage, but their workers could still get covered contraceptives that would be paid for by the insurer or the employer plan's administrator.\n\nOver 55 million US women have birth control coverage with zero out-of-pocket costs, according to the National Women's Law Center. The mandate saved women an estimated $1.4 billion on birth control pills alone in 2013, according to the center.\n\nExperts have pointed out that many women use birth control methods for more than pregnancy prevention, including treatment of hormonal imbalances and endometriosis.\n\n\"There is no way to know how many women will be affected,\" said Alina Salganicoff, director of women's health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on health policy research and communications.\n\n\"HHS leaders under the current administration are focused on turning back the clock on women's health,\" Dr. Haywood L. Brown, president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , said in a statement. \"Reducing access to contraceptive coverage threatens to reverse the tremendous progress our nation has made in recent years in lowering the unintended pregnancy rate.\"\n\nBrown said that weakening contraception coverage could also take a toll on maternal mortality, community health and economic stability of women and families.\n\n\"Birth control is not controversial -- it's health care the vast majority of women will use in the course of their lifetime,\" Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement.\n\n\"Nine out of ten women of reproductive age will use birth control in their lifetime. This administration is carrying out a full-scale attack on birth control,\" Richards said. \"We cannot allow President Trump to roll back the progress women have made over the past century.\"\n\nFriday's move comes more than three years after the US Supreme Court ruled that \"closely held corporations\" -- in that case, Hobby Lobby -- could be exempt from providing certain kinds of birth control to their employees.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions also released \"interpretative guidance\" Friday directing all federal agencies to comply with existing protections for religious liberty under federal law and Supreme Court precedent.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"The constitutional protection of religious beliefs and the right to exercise those beliefs have served this country well, have made us one of the most tolerant countries in the world, and have also helped make us the freeist and most generous,\" Sessions said in a statement. \"President Trump promised that this administration would 'lead by example on religious liberty,' and he is delivering on that promise.\"\n\nA Justice Department official explained, however, that Sessions' directive is limited in scope: \"It's not a policy document. It doesn't create or authorize the creation of any new protections. It simply summarizes the state of the law as it exists today.\"\n\nThe official explained that the department's guidance was issued because Trump directed Sessions to do so in his May executive order.\n\nWhen asked what was different between Thursday and today, the official said, \"nothing, as a matter of law.\"",

                  "TEXT": "(CNN) There is pleasure in both giving and receiving. Does gender influence which of these pleasures we prefer?\n\nIn women,part of the brain showed a greater response when sharing money, while in men, the same structure showed more activity whenthey kept the cash for themselves, a small study published Monday in Nature Human Behavior found.\n\nSearching the brain for answers\n\nWomen tend to be more altruistic than men, previous studies have shown.\n\nAs Philippe Tobler, co-author of the new study, sees it, \"women put more subjective value on prosocial behavior and men find selfish behavior more valuable.\"\n\n\"However, it was unknown how this difference comes about at the level of the brain,\" Tobler, an associate professor of neuroeconomics and social neuroscience at University of Zurich, wrote in an email. \"But in both genders, the dopamine system encodes value.\"\n\nBy \"encode,\" he means the activity in our brain changes in proportion to the value we give social experiences.\n\nSearching for answers for why women and men are not equally selfish, he and his colleagues focused on the dopamine system.\n\nDopamine, which plays a fundamental role in the brain's reward system, is released during moments of pleasure, yet it also helps us process our values. This mental ability transpires within the brain machinery known as the striatum. Latin for \"striped,\" the striatum is threaded with fibers that receive and transmit signals from the cerebral cortex, the thalamus and other brain regions.\n\nTobler and his colleagues designed a series of experiments to test how dopamine might influence the behavior of men and women. Fifty-six male and female participants made choices between sharing a financial reward with others or keeping the money for themselves.\n\nGiven only a placebo before making decisions, women acted less selfishly than men, choosing to share their money with others. However, when their dopamine systems were disrupted after they received a drug called amisulpride, women acted more selfishly, while men became more generous. Amisulpride is an antipsychotic normally used to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia.\n\n\"Based on the opposing priorities of the genders, interfering with the dopamine system has opposing effects,\" Tobler said.\n\nIn a second experiment, the researchers used functional MRI to investigate changes in the brain while eight female and nine male participants made choices. Compared with the males, the striatum in females showed more activity when they made a prosocial decision.\n\nAccording to Anne Z. Murphy, an associate professor of neuroscience at Georgia State University, other research has shown \"that females are more prosocial. We find it more rewarding, and if you manipulate dopamine signaling in the brain, you can make females less prosocial and males less selfish.\" Murphy was not involved in the study.\n\nStill, she said, the study brings \"greater awareness to the fact that there are brain differences in male and females.\"\n\n\"It just shows, once again, that people can point to a biological basis for some of the characteristics that are prototypically male,\" Murphy said. These traits would include selfishness, self-promotion, generally, a hard-driving profile.\n\n\"Now, you can point to another biological basis for it,\" she added, \"And rather than using this knowledge to divide us, maybe we can use this to help make society a better place.\"\n\nFor instance, she said, when women act in more altruistic ways, they shouldn't be regarded as less deserving than male colleagues who are more self-promoting.\n\nGender differences in the brain may not be due to structural differences -- for example, variations in region size or shape based on sex, noted the researchers. Gender differences in the brain could be functional. This would mean a flood of the very same neurotransmitter -- dopamine -- might cause a very different response in women than in men.\n\n\"It may be worth pointing out that the differences are likely to be learned,\" Tobler said.\n\nThough male and female tendencies may be learned, Murphy said, these behaviors are not acquired in a single lifetime.\n\n'Shaped by history'\n\nInstead, these preferences develop over time based on the differing roles of females and males: \"reproduction versus resource-gathering,\" Murphy said.\n\n\"You see similar behavior in rodents,\" she said, noting that female rats act in more altruistic ways than males. \"It's evolutionarily conserved. It's shaped by history.\"\n\nThe study has implications for drug research, Tobler noted.\n\n\"Historically, medical drugs were often tested primarily on men and sometimes drugs have been found to be more effective in men than women,\" he wrote.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nMurphy explained that \"preclinical studies have shown that females require approximately twice the amount of morphine than males to produce the same level of analgesia.\"\n\nAll opiates that are metabolized in one specific way produce what is known as a \"sexually dimorphic response,\" she added.\n\n\"People are starting to look at whether cannabinoids are sexually dimorphic. It's been suggested that cannabinoids are more effective in females than in males,\" she said, with a lot of preclinical data showing this is the case.",

                  "TEXT": "Patrick R. Krill is a licensed attorney, board certified alcohol and drug counselor, author and advocate. He is the director of the Legal Professionals Program at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\nAs is now customary with the passing of public figures, social media exploded with condolences for the family of the late Mayor Rob Ford on Tuesday, making it clear that a man once the subject of merciless ridicule was now being afforded a level of sympathy and kindness unfathomable just a few short years ago.\n\nAcross the Internet and media, punchlines have largely been replaced by dignified tributes, and crude caricatures by staid, objective reporting. Why? Because Rob Ford, alive as an alcoholic, was apparently less deserving of compassion and understanding than Rob Ford, now dead from cancer.\n\nTrue, the fond remembrances and generous consolations are heartening, refreshing expressions of decency towards a family in grieving, and yes, they should be acknowledged and welcomed as such. To be clear, however, they are also the indisputable byproduct of the type of image makeover nobody wants — a cancer diagnosis.\n\nFueling Ford's trajectory from viciously mocked to politely mourned, his cancer demonstrated how malleable our emotional responses are in light of our moralizations. Rob Ford was, after all, a man who suffered from two life-threatening diseases but garnered sympathy for only one. Perhaps that dichotomy is worth us, as a society, examining.\n\nWhen I first wrote about Ford for CNN in 2013 , I hoped to make the point that he wasn't that different from many people all around you — outwardly successful while secretly buckling under the weight of alcohol or drugs — and that addiction is a nondiscriminatory predator that strikes everywhere. But despite addiction's widespread presence and nonbiased grasp, a significant majority of society still doesn't view it — or react to it — the way we do other, less stigmatized diseases that makes us want to reach out and support the sufferer.\n\nIn fact, it wasn't until Ford was diagnosed with what is unequivocally accepted as a \"real\" disease that many were able to accept, forgive and even admire him for his fight to survive. Sadly for the hundreds of thousands of people who die from the disease of addiction every year, such acceptance and forgiveness never comes.\n\nIn a study published the year after Rob Ford first made international headlines for his struggles with drugs and alcohol, researchers from Johns Hopkins found that 90% of people would not want someone with addiction to marry into their family, and 78% did not want to work alongside addicted people.\n\nFurthermore, survey respondents were more willing to accept discriminatory practices against persons with drug addiction, more skeptical about the effectiveness of treatments, and more likely to oppose policies aimed at helping them. It is impossible to even conceive of similar statistics for cancer, diabetes, or heart disease, and you won't see \"Saturday Night Live\" doing a sendup of a politician's COPD or epilepsy symptoms anytime soon.\n\nWhy is it that we continue to deride sufferers of one disease and openly project benevolence and humanity towards victims of another? Is emotional parity for diseases truly beyond our capacity, even between two that are felling ourselves and neighbors at a frequency and volume that leaves no life untouched?\n\nDespite the fact that excessive drinking is responsible for one in 10 deaths among working-aged Americans, or that drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, we rarely see the type of outward support for, and rallying around, people struggling with addiction as we do other illnesses.\n\nFamilies are often times left to shoulder their emotional burden alone in shame and silence, an injustice made final when underlying causes of death are cloaked behind less scrutiny-inviting terms like \"liver failure,\" or \"heart disease.\"\n\nAlthough even many forms of cancer itself are caused by heavy drinking, you're unlikely to see blameworthy \"alcoholism\" listed in the obituary of a throat cancer victim. After all, few families left behind would choose to diminish sympathy and invite judgment for their deceased loved one. But is a forced choice between honesty and sympathy really the best we can do?\n\nIn the absence of available proof to the contrary, I'll make the assumption that Rob Ford would have been extended at least some level of eulogistic courtesy had his other disease taken his life. At least that's what I'll hope. But what we can't overlook is how compassion and empathy were scarce commodities during his high-profile battle with addiction, and how they shouldn't have been.\n\nAddiction is a sadly pervasive struggle in our world, present in your neighborhood and mine. The Rob Fords of the world are all around us, and they shouldn't have to die of cancer before we can view them humanely, on social media or otherwise.",

We can understand how they are built and how they act and how they work together in large communities.\"\n\n\"Soon there are no more secrets,\" she said.\n\n'Immense' practical use\n\nUntil now, scientists have been unable to produce detailed images of many biological molecules that are the building blocks of life.\n\nPrevious techniques often required the use of dyes or fixatives to help see these molecules. In the past, electron microscopes were also assumed to be useful only in imaging dead material due to electron beams destroying biological matter.\n\nNow, with the development of cryo-electron microscopy, researchers can freeze biomolecules mid-movement and observe how they act -- and interact.\n\nSpeaking at the conference by telephone, Frank said that the development of cryo-electron microscopy \"fills an important gap and extends the range of molecules that can be determined at atomic resolution.\"\n\nThe final technical hurdle was overcome in 2013, when a new type of electron detector came into use. pic.twitter.com/Ue9c0R6v7y — The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 4, 2017\n\nHe described the practical uses of the technique as \"immense\" but said that it would take several years before the implications would be fully understood.\n\nFrank was born in Germany in 1940 and is now a professor at Columbia University in New York.\n\nHis Swiss colleague Dubochet was born in 1942 and is honorary professor of biophysics at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.\n\nThe third recipient, Richard Henderson, was born in Scotland in 1945 and works at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England.\n\nInitial reactions from the academic community of chemists have been positive.\n\nJohn Hardy, professor of neuroscience at University College London, described the development of cryo-electron microscopy as \"transformative.\"\n\n\"To give one example, last year the 3D structure of the enzyme producing the amyloid (protein) of Alzheimer's disease was published using this technology,\" Hardy said. \"Knowing this structure opens up the possibility of rational drug design in this area.\"\n\n\"A visual image is the essential component to understanding,\" said Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, professor of mammalian development and stem-cell biology at the University of Cambridge. Such an image is often the first thing to \"open our eyes, and so our minds, to a scientific breakthrough.\"\n\nThe prize comes with an award of 9 million Swedish kronor ($1.1 million), shared when there are multiple recipients.\n\nPrevious winners include Marie Curie, known for her pioneering work on radioactivity, and Mario J. Molina, the first person to discover the damaging effect of CFC gases (found in refrigerators and spray cans) on the ozone layer.\n\nChemistry was the second prize mentioned in Alfred Nobel's 1895 will and was the most important of the sciences for his own work, according to the official website of the Nobel Prize.",

She was just 14 years old, scared, vulnerable, and alone.\n\n\"I was very young, I didn't have my father or mother, no one,\" she says.\n\nCarrera says she found work on a farm, and it wasn't long before her supervisor tried to take advantage of her. He promised her an easier job inside a warehouse. But as soon as she got in his truck, she says, he drove to a remote part of the farm and tried to force her to have sex with him.\n\n\"He told me if we don't do this the easy way, we'll do it the hard way. I was afraid and trembling,\" she says.\n\nNow 35, Carrera recalls with gratitude the farmworker who heard her screams and rescued her before she could be raped. She also remembers how they both were fired the next day.\n\nProtections against that type of labor abuse against migrant workers in the United States were virtually non-existent in the 1990's.\n\n\"No one knew anything about rights,\" Carrera says. \"We didn't seek out what our worker rights were. We just accepted everything they told us and just did our jobs.\"\n\nCoalition of Immokalee Workers\n\nIn 1993, a group of American activists and migrant farmworkers decided to change that. They founded the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a non-profit grassroots organization dedicated to improving wages and working conditions of migrant farmworkers.\n\nThe organization is named after the migrant town of Immokalee, Florida, the epicenter of tomato production in the United States. Ninety-percent of all winter tomatoes consumed in the US come from Florida. Immokalee also used to be known as ground zero for modern day slavery.\n\nCIW co-founder Laura Germino explains how the group evolved into an anti-slavery organization.\n\n\"We began to come across situations where workers were being held against their will, where they weren't free to leave,\" Germino says.\n\nA truck on a tomato farm in Immokalee.\n\nThe first case they discovered was eventually prosecuted in a federal case called U.S. vs Flores.\n\n\"In that one, we found out that workers were being held by armed guards, prevented from leaving, pistol whipped, some sexually assaulted, and it was a crew of 500 workers,\" says Germino.\n\nGermino says she and her colleagues initially thought it was just a single case. An anomaly, she says.\n\n\"But then we came across another case and another case and that's how I became introduced to labor trafficking.\"\n\nSince that first case, the CIW has uncovered and helped the US government successfully prosecute eight cases of slave labor on Florida farms.\n\nThe cases are highlighted in a mobile museum that Germino uses to educate people about the issue.\n\nJUST WATCHED Slavery in the food supply chain Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Slavery in the food supply chain 04:42\n\nFair Food Program\n\nToday, the CIW's focus is no longer uncovering cases of slavery. Instead, it's aim is preventing them from happening in the first place through an initiative it calls the Fair Food Program.\n\nParticipants in the program, which include 90% of tomato growers in Florida , allow CIW staff to come onto their properties and hold mandatory education sessions for all employees. The workers receive booklets that outline their rights and a hotline to call if they experience violations.\n\nThe growers also agree to regular third-party inspections of their farms. When they visit, a team of auditors speaks confidentially with at least 50% of workers to ensure their rights are being respected.\n\nThe Fair Food Program operates in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nLaura Safer Espinoza is a former Supreme Court Justice for the State of New York. She now spends her retirement in Florida, running the Fair Food Standards Council, which oversees the audits.\n\n\"Places that were called ground zero for modern day slavery by federal prosecutors a few years ago are now cited by national and international human rights experts as the best work environment in U.S. agriculture,\" she says.\n\nJudge Laura, as she is affectionately called by everyone who works with her, says the code works because it was created by the very people it is designed to protect.\n\n\"The code that we get to monitor and enforce is unique because it was written by workers who are the ultimate experts on human rights in the agricultural settings in which they work.\"\n\nThe program also includes real market consequences for farms if violations are found.\n\nWorkers pick tomatoes on a farm in Immokalee, Florida.\n\nAs Judge Laura explains, \"if a participating grower is not complying with the code of conduct after multiple chances and opportunities with the Fair Food Standards Council to work toward compliance, ultimately they are suspended. That means they cannot sell their produce to now 14 major retail buyers.\"\n\nThose buyers include many of the biggest fast food restaurants and grocery stores, including McDonalds, Taco Bell, Whole Foods Market and Walmart. As part of the agreement, they all pledge to purchase tomatoes only from Fair Food Program farms.\n\nThey also agree to pay a penny more per pound of tomatoes, money that goes directly to the farmworkers as a line-item bonus. In some cases, it doubles their paychecks.\n\nAlejandrina Carrera appreciates the extra money, but is most grateful for the change in how she is treated on the job.\n\n\"You're not going to be harassed, you're not going to be insulted, you're not going to be forced to work. There's more respect now,\" she says.\n\nCarrera came to Immokalee dreaming of a better life for herself. Today she dreams of a better life for her three children. They are all in school and she wants them to go on to college and have careers.\n\nHer youngest kids are seven and nine. The oldest is 14, the same age she was when she first came to Florida.",

                  "TEXT": "You're down with acai, take echinacea on the reg, and consider coconut oil a mainstay in your home. But a new class of high-powered superfoods is pushing the envelope even further, making even the healthiest among us stop and do a double take. For starters, there's Gwyneth's pricy morning smoothie ritual (whose ingredient shopping list totals $200 thanks to so-called \" moon dust \"). And then there's something called Blue Majik and ... astrologically farmed eggs?\n\n\"We're always looking for a quick fix, miracle ingredient or drug to cure our issues and make us healthier,\" says Isabel Smith, MS, RD, CDN and Founder of Isabel Smith Nutrition . \"When we find something that sounds almost too crazy to be true, we assume it's the next miracle worker and hop on board.\" But not so fast, she says. \"It's always important to understand fully what we're putting into our bodies before we do so.\"\n\nFind out if these hot health trends (and often hefty price tags) can live up to their claims.\n\n5 Crazy New Health Food Trends\n\n1. Astrologically Farmed Eggs\n\nYes, this is a thing, thanks to London's uber cool Hemsley sisters . It's the next step in biodynamic farming, where crops are planted based on the phase of the moon -- and on 100 percent ethical, self-sufficient land. Think organic -- x 100. For eggs, farmers use a moon almanac to birth healthier chickens, which supposedly lay super delicious eggs. But is all the extra hands-on attention worth it (and the extra 15 cents per egg)?\n\n\"Not using hormones or antibiotics in the process of growing chickens is definitely beneficial, but it may not differ from other organic methods,\" says Smith. \"No research really exists on this.\" While Smith notes that eggs are a good source of protein and nutrients like lutein, which may prevent age-related macular degeneration, you don't have to pay the astronomical price for these star-crossed eggs.\n\n2. Blue Majik\n\n\"This is basically spirulina, which is a source of chlorophyll, energizing B vitamins and iron,\" says Smith. According to Smith, chlorophyll also includes nutrients like vitamins A and C and magnesium. \"[Blue majik] contains a compound called phycocyanin, which may also have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but research has been done widely in mice.\" At $60 for 30 single packets, you might be better off sticking with your regular microalgae supplement.\n\n3. Cordyceps\n\nThere are plenty of magic mushrooms on the market, but this fungus that grows on caterpillar larva is the latest 'It' 'shroom (and an ingredient in Gwyneth Paltrow's morning smoothie). Advocates claim the fungus helps with oxygen uptake, stamina (on the field and in the bedroom) and recovery — not to mention boasts anti-cancer properties. Sounds pretty great, right?\n\nAside from its long use in Traditional Chinese Medicine, there isn't really much science to back it up. \"No research in humans has found any improvement in trained athletes,\" says Smith. A study from Brigham Young University found that it did not improve performance in trained cyclists. As for the cancer and libido claims? Most research has been done in animals, not humans. Given its high price tag ( $30 for 2.4 ounces ), you can probably pass on this one.\n\n4. Ashwagandha\n\nYes, it's a mouthful, but the adaptogenic herb — aka Indian Ginseng — has been touted for everything from lowering cortisol levels to balancing thyroid hormones to fighting cancer. And yes, it's also an ingredient in Gwyneth's morning elixir. You can take it in capsule form or a bit of the powder or tincture to your daily juice or smoothie.\n\nAccording to Smith, the herb has been used in Ayurveda and in many cultures for many years. \"There has been some research that suggests that Ashwaganda may be beneficial in the areas of boosting immunity, joint health, adrenal gland support and hormone balance,\" she says. \"But more research in humans is needed.\" If you choose to try it, remember it's a powerful herb and may interact with other medications or herbs you may be taking. \"Be sure to be in touch with your medical provider when taking it,\" says Smith.\n\n5. Cannabis\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nEver since marijuana has gained favor in the medical community, it's been shooting for superherb status. It's been touted to improve athletic performance, relieve pain (including PMS symptoms) and reduce anxiety. Now, MJ is being added to edibles too -- and we're not just talking about pot brownies here. You'll find cannabis-infused into coconut oil, teas and even canna-butter. Proponents also claim that it will help you detox. (Yes, there really is a cannabis cleanse . [PDF])",

                  "TEXT": "Michael D'Antonio is the author of the new book \"Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success\" (St. Martin's Press) and is due to be a guest on \"CNN Newsroom\" Monday in the 10 a.m. hour. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) Given a straighforward opportunity to disavow the most dangerous brand of hatred in American history, the man who has declared, \"I'm, like, a really smart person\" couldn't do it.\n\n\"I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists,\" said Donald Trump in a response to CNN's Jake Tapper. \"So I don't know. I don't know -- did he endorse me, or what's going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists.\"\n\nThe statement was classic Trump: a chopped salad made out of words. But the two parts were clear. \"I know nothing about David Duke,\" he said. \"I know nothing about white supremacists.\" (Trump later tweeted a disavowal.)\n\nEvery literate American adult, and certainly anyone running for president, must know that Duke is the former leader of the Ku Klux Klan and that white supremacists promote a violently racist ideology that plagues America.\n\nThe 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people, including 21 kids in a daycare center, was associated with if not inspired by white supremacy.\n\nSince 9/11 white supremacists and other domestic terrorists have carried out more deadly attacks on American soil than Muslim extremists. It was a white supremacist who killed nine people at a Bible study at a Charleston, South Carolina, church last summer.\n\nConcern about racist support for Trump arose last week when David Duke said on Facebook that he liked Trump's stands on certain issues and the way the candidate exposed \"lies\" perpetrated by the press and believed he will ensure \"that White-Americans are allowed to preserve and promote their heritage and interests just as all other groups are allowed to do.\"\n\nWhen first informed of Duke's support on Friday, Trump didn't have any trouble recognizing the name. \"David Duke endorsed me?\" he said. \"OK, all right. I disavow, OK?\" This makes sense, given the fact that Duke is notorious for hate-mongering and Trump named him years ago when he explained why he dropped out of the old Reform Party. Back then, and again on Friday, he knew who Duke was and seemed to recognize that he's political poison.\n\nTrump's tune changed 48 hours before polls would open for Super Tuesday primaries, many of them in Southern states. Suddenly he was unable to place Duke's name and he didn't know a thing about the movement that keeps white racist extremism alive in America.\n\nThis from a fellow who is famous for recalling every detail of every deal he ever made and who never forgets those who offend him. If Duke was so bad that his presence drove Trump out of the Reform Party, it's unlikely he's forgotten him.\n\nWhat's going on here? As someone who has spent many hours with Trump and devoted two years to piecing together the story of his life, I can tell you that Trump is not speaking out of ignorance. He is, as he says, \"very smart,\" and he understands the effects of what he says. And he has been signaling where he stands when it comes to race for many years.\n\nBefore declaring for president, Trump spent much of the Obama presidency as the loudest voice of the \"birthers\" who repeatedly claimed that Barack Obama was born, not in Hawaii, as documents prove, but abroad. And therefore he was not a U.S. citizen, and not a legitimate president, in Trump's eyes.\n\nBirtherism was a barely disguised effort to paint the first black president as an un-American other and was energized by racial animus. Trump played the game long after others disavowed it and went further, suggesting the President might not be a Christian, as he says, but perhaps instead a Muslim.\n\nThe insinuation, like Trump's suggestion that the truth about Obama's college years was somehow clouded, was a divisive kind of gutter politics.\n\nAlways comfortable going further than others, Trump was the man who responded to the arrest of five minority youths in the 1989 assault of a jogger in New York's Central Park with newspaper ads that said, \"Bring Back The Death Penalty, Bring Back the Police.\"\n\nWhen Trump and I discussed the five -- who were coerced into false confessions but eventually cleared of the crime -- he wasn't interested in discussing any part of it except for his belief that they were bad characters who deserved no consideration for the years they spent in prison.\n\nThe Trump record on race also includes the ridiculous assertion, made in a TV interview with Bryant Gumbel, that \"A well-educated black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market.\"\n\nTrump also appeared as a witness at a congressional hearing on Indian casinos -- they were his competitors -- and said, \"Organized crime is rampant on Indian reservations.\" He then offered his belief that Native Americans at the hearing where he spoke \"don't look like Indians to me, and they don't look like Indians to Indians.\"\n\nTrump's tendency to play with racial fire is a longstanding element of his style and personality. When he was a marginal political figure, no one dwelled much on this problem. But as he lurches toward the Republican nomination for president, it's important to understand that he always knows what he is saying and always acts with an intention in mind. He is, after all, a really smart person.",

                  "TEXT": "Washington (CNN) Tom Price, the embattled health and human services secretary, resigned Friday in the midst of a scandal over his use of private planes , a storm that enraged President Donald Trump and undercut his promise to bring accountability to Washington.\n\nPrice's departure came as he's being investigated by the department's inspector general for using private jets for multiple government business trips, even to fly distances often as short as from Washington to Philadelphia. The cost for the trips ran into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe scandal infuriated Trump, who viewed the controversy as a needless distraction from his agenda. Over the course of the week, Trump fumed to aides about Price's flights, which he deemed \"stupid,\" according to multiple sources. Instead of moving past the storm, Price's offer to reimburse the government for only a fraction of the flights' costs enraged Trump further.\n\nSpeaking less than an hour before the resignation was announced, Trump bemoaned the optics of the matter, which he said obscured what otherwise had been a cost-saving tenure.\n\n\"I was disappointed because I didn't like it, cosmetically or otherwise. I was disappointed,\" Trump said.\n\nPrice and his aides have insisted that the trips he took by private charter jet had been approved through the usual legal and ethics offices at HHS. But the appearance of a millionaire Cabinet secretary flying routes easily navigated by far cheaper means proved an optics nightmare for an administration already accused of being out of touch with regular Americans.\n\nPrice is the latest casualty in an administration that's seen a high rate of dramatic departures over its first eight months. Since taking office, Trump has dismissed or seen quit his national security adviser, press secretary, communications director, chief strategist, acting attorney general and FBI director. The tumult has come as Trump struggles to fulfill key aspects of his agenda on Capitol Hill, and as his team confronts its most dire challenge yet on a storm-demolished Puerto Rico.\n\nTrump was incensed that Price's actions undermined his vow to \"drain the swamp,\" though Price is not the only Cabinet official to have used private air charters to travel around the country. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke have both flown on private planes during their tenures in the administration.\n\nThe White House said this week it was examining whether to adopt stricter oversight of Cabinet secretaries' travel plans.\n\nThe first sign of Trump's ire emerged on Wednesday, when he said only \"we'll see\" after being asked if he was planning to fire Price. Neither Trump nor his top aides could say in the following days whether Price retained the President's confidence.\n\nDeparting the White House on Friday, Trump called Price a \"very fine man\" who had nonetheless made a grave mistake.\n\n\"This is an administration that saves hundreds of millions of dollars on renegotiating things,\" Trump said. \"So I don't like to see somebody that perhaps there's the perception that it wasn't right.\"\n\nThe resignation was announced as Trump flew aboard Air Force One for another weekend at his golf club in New Jersey. Stepping off his own plane, Trump offered a thumbs-up sign when reporters asked if he'd accepted Price's resignation.\n\nPrice himself offered a rosy picture of his future on Thursday evening, telling CNN that he \"absolutely\" planned to stay on as health secretary -- a claim that was ultimately not meant to be.\n\nNot close\n\nJUST WATCHED Tom Price vows reimbursement for flights Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tom Price vows reimbursement for flights 01:34\n\nTrump, who never grew as close to Price as he has to some of his aides, also viewed the health secretary as an ineffective promoter of Republican plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, an effort that has failed multiple times over the course of Trump's eight months in office.\n\nDuring a rally with Boy Scouts in July, Trump quipped that if Price couldn't wrangle the votes, he'd dismiss him.\n\n\"He better get them. Oh, he better,\" Trump said. \"Otherwise I'll say, 'Tom, you're fired.' \"\n\nPrice didn't get the votes, but it was his use of private aircraft that ultimately led to his demise in the Trump administration.\n\nPolitico first reported Price's use of charter jets for official business last week and found that the secretary has traveled on charter flights at least 24 times since May, citing people familiar with his travel plans and a review of HHS documents.\n\nCharter plane operators estimated 24 flights would have cost $400,000, Politico reported. Commercial trips would have cost thousands of dollars less. The Health and Human Services inspector general is reviewing whether the means of travel was appropriate.\n\nLater, it was revealed that Price also took US military aircraft on two trips abroad, bringing the total cost of his non-commercial travel to more than $1 million. The military flights were approved by the White House.\n\nBreaking precedent\n\nJUST WATCHED Price experiencing turbulence for private flights Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Price experiencing turbulence for private flights 04:39\n\nPrice's travel breaks with the precedent set by former President Barack Obama's HHS secretaries Sylvia Mathews Burwell and Kathleen Sebelius, who flew commercially when flying within the US.\n\nPrice said in a statement on Thursday that would write a personal check to the US Treasury to cover the cost of his travel on private charter planes.\n\n\"The taxpayers won't pay a dime for my seat on those planes,\" he proclaimed, though it was later revealed he would only pay for his seat and not the total cost of chartering a plane.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson said the check would come to $51,887.31, a small percentage of the total cost of the private flights.\n\nPrice, both in his role as Trump's health boss and as a Republican congressman from Georgia, was a frequent critic of government spending. He told CNN in April that he wanted to cut redundancy and waste in his agency.\n\n\"For us to say, 'OK, let's just throw more money at that system, let's see if more money helps that out,' is the wrong way,\" Price told CNN's Sanjay Gupta.\n\nWhile at HHS, Price played an integral part helping craft many iterations of alternatives to Obamacare -- all of which ultimately failed to pass. Price was also part of the executive opioid commission announced by Trump in March.\n\nPrior to his role in the administration, Price was a Georgia representative for over 10 years, and was an orthopedic surgeon for 20 years. He was the third doctor to hold the HHS secretary position.",

                  "TEXT": "This is Week 41 of a yearlong series: A Catholic Reads the Bible . Read Week 1, Week 2 and Week 3 . Laura Bernardini is director of coverage in CNN's Washington Bureau. The views expressed in this column belong to Bernardini\n\n(CNN) Last weekend, I went to Mass with my Mom in Vermont. As we were sitting in a pew, she pushed the hymnal in front of me, warning me that the next song was \"Be Not Afraid.\"\n\nMy eyes always water when we sing that song.\n\nAny kid that has gone to Catholic school knows \"Be Not Afraid.\" You never forget it.\n\nIt also has special meaning in my family. It was sung at my Dad's funeral.\n\nThe words are truly beautiful: \"Be not afraid, I go before you always.\"\n\nWhen I got home, I was reading the Gospel of Mark, and the familiar story of Jesus walking on water got me thinking about fear.\n\nEveryone also knows this story. When I was a kid, I had an illustrated book about it. Plus, every kid tries to walk on water with no success.\n\nIn Mark's Gospel, Jesus goes out to meet the disciples in a boat, but \"they thought it was a ghost and cried out.\"\n\nJesus' response was \"Take courage, it is I, do not be afraid.\" Mark uses the word \"astounded\" to describe the disciples' reaction.\n\nReading this story with the experience of the last 40 weeks really got me thinking. (It's funny that 40 is such a big number in the Bible.)\n\nHow does faith tackle fear?\n\nI have already confessed to you that I was a pretty scared kid in school. I may have been the only second grader that knew Franklin Delano Roosevelt's words of \"there is nothing to fear, but fear itself\" from his first inaugural address. My Mom turned it into the mantra that got me through the rough days.\n\nHeck, I was afraid to write this column.\n\nAnd like other passages that I have written about, I discovered a surprise. It comes after Jesus tells the disciples not to be afraid.\n\n\"They had not understood the incident of the loaves. On the contrary, their hearts were hardened.\"\n\nI don't remember this part from my children's book. I also didn't quite understand it.\n\nMy Bible's footnotes weren't helpful, so I consulted \"The New Jerome Biblical Commentary.\"\n\nThe hardening of hearts is about not understanding Jesus as the Son of God, the book explains. The disciples hadn't understood the constant stream of miracles -- including the multiplication of the fish and loaves -- was telling them all they needed to know about Jesus. Fear had hardened their hearts, and clouded their eyes.\n\nFear cripples us even to this day. This week especially, there is so much fear and distrust in the world. This passage presented a moment for reflection: How are our hearts hardened against each other? And how can faith help us overcome our fear?",

                  "TEXT": "Seni Sulyman is Country Director of Andela Nigeria. He is passionate about building an ecosystem of exemplary African businesses and leaders and has an MBA from Harvard Business School. Andela this week announced a $40M round of funding from two Africa-focused venture funds. The views expressed in this article are solely his.\n\n(CNN) Humans have done a poor job of equipping the majority of our seven billion peers to contribute meaningfully toward our collective future.\n\nAs a result, humankind is not advancing at the pace it should be.\n\nToday, millions of children lack access to education and healthcare, and are all too familiar with poverty and hunger. Our planet is exhibiting severe side effects resulting from human activity while we still debate the existence of climate change.\n\nElections in developed countries are no longer guaranteed to be free and fair, thanks to hackers. This is 2017.\n\nAfrica, home to a massive young and growing population , could possess the solution to the global human capital dilemma. Africans, working alongside and leading global teams, can help humankind avoid catastrophes in healthcare, education, climate change, and cybersecurity.\n\nBy producing the next wave of global leaders, Africa (and Africans) will play a critical role in building the future.\n\nIf we're going to actualize this promising future, we need to first come to terms with our difficult past.\n\nA history of missed opportunities\n\nOver 12,000 years ago, humans shifted from hunting and gathering to organized agriculture. Africans participated actively in what is widely known as the Agricultural Revolution, spanning several centuries across several kingdoms\n\nWe've since slid in both productivity and innovation, failing to achieve food security, and have some of the highest rates of undernourishment globally. The reasons vary and we can debate them, but the consequences are irrefutable\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, humans developed the steam engine, created the textile industry, invented machine tools and factories, and built telecommunication, transportation and power infrastructure.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution, as we know it today, is commonly referred to as the most important event in human history since the domestication of animals. Africa was a source of key raw materials and labor that fueled this revolution , yet once again the benefits of this revolution skipped most African economies.\n\nToday, the repercussions of these missed opportunities are vast. With the collapse of most of Africa's major empires either via self-destruction or colonization, our interactions with the world have become severely imbalanced and our development has been disappointingly slow.\n\nMany African countries are net importers of necessities like food, fuel, equipment and consumer goods. In Nigeria, 75 percent of land is arable, yet we import unreasonable quantities of rice, tomatoes and other basic agricultural produce. We literally can't feed ourselves.\n\nIn terms of industry, things are equally appalling. While banking and telecommunications (which we've basically imported) are shining examples of success in many countries, our public transport infrastructure is rudimentary at best, hospital conditions are deplorable, and electricity is a luxury.\n\nFor the past few centuries, Africans have certainly not been sitting around resigned to stagnation and exploitation. Yet we've largely missed out on two of the most important episodes of global advancement.\n\nThe prayers, hopes and aspirations of our colonized ancestors did not propel us into the 21st century. Today, our prayers, hopes and aspirations will not propel us into the future.\n\nThis is our history. Let's embrace it. Let's learn from it.\n\nToday, the world is on the precipice of its third major revolution: The digital revolution. This time, Africa will not be left behind and history will not repeat itself.\n\nRaw brainpower\n\nWe are fortunate to have a massive advantage over previous generations: the internet. The internet is the global equalizer. It has fundamentally changed how knowledge is shared and opportunities are accessed.\n\nWith a connected device and a desire to learn, anyone can tap into the knowledge, experience and insights from the world's greatest minds and communities, irrespective of where they are. As a result, our continent's ability to partake in the digital revolution is contingent upon the strength of our human capital and our leadership.\n\nAfrica is projected to account for half the world's population growth by 2050 , and has the sheer capacity and the raw brainpower to produce technologists who will go on to build the future.\n\nThe emergence of a new crop of young, thoughtful and upright leaders -- who are committed to creating immense value and leaving their communities better off -- is what will fully unlock the potential of millions of Africans in ways we can't yet possibly imagine.\n\nJust 10 years ago, \"young and tech-savvy Nigerian\" was synonymous with \"internet fraudster.\" Today, the world recognizes that some of our future technology leaders are located in cities like Lagos, Abuja, Nairobi and Kampala.\n\nBy investing in young African leaders, one at a time, and then applying the learnings to rapidly scale those efforts to millions of others , we can catalyze an entire generation. It's already happening, led by young Africans. We don't need anyone's permission.\n\nHuman capital shortage\n\nThe world's human capital shortage -- the constraint to the digital revolution and to the advancement of humankind -- is a global dilemma that affects all of us, regardless of ethnicity, geography or socioeconomic status.\n\nChanging Africa's history of getting left behind is not a choice, it's a necessity. The role that future generations of Africans will play is already being determined by the actions and decisions we make today.\n\nHaving an African fund lead what is easily one of the largest venture rounds on the continent is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nIf Africans are successful at accelerating our participation in the global technology revolution, we will not only begin to solve Africa's most pressing challenges, we will in fact begin to solve the world's.",

                  "TEXT": "Washington (CNN) Most white working-class voters who are evangelical Christians -- like most white evangelicals -- would consider voting for Donald Trump.\n\nBut it's not because they believe he shares their conservative Christian values. Rather, they agree with him that America is not as great as it once was, according to a new CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation poll.\n\nWhile black evangelicals are solidly against the GOP nominee, among white working-class evangelicals, about three in four -- 76% -- say they'd consider voting for Trump.\n\nPartisanship likely plays a big part in this, as half of white working-class evangelical Christians identify as Republicans.\n\nThe majority -- 6 in 10 -- of voters in this group believe the US' better days are in the past and most are concerned that the country is becoming less Christian. Nearly 90% of working class whites who are evangelical Christians believe Christian values are under attack in America today.\n\nWhile most Christian groups -- 73% of mainline Protestants and 61% of Catholics -- share this view, only 41% of those with no religious preference believe these values are under attack.\n\nTrump often says he wants to \"make America great again,\" and working-class whites are a core of his support, but that doesn't mean they don't question the faith of a man who once said he never asks God for forgiveness\n\n\"When listening to him, he's not a Christian. He does not have any of the values that we have,\" said Buddy Mitchell, a 47-year-old from Arvada, Colorado, and owner of a flooring company.\n\n\"I don't know of any redeeming quality of Donald Trump other than both Democrats and Republicans hate him,\" said Mitchell, who did not participate in the survey. \"That's the only reason I like him: that the establishment doesn't like him.\"\n\nChristian values seen as under attack\n\nThat dislike for the establishment is a strong point for Trump with this demographic. For many white working-class evangelicals, it's clear who is at fault for many of the country's issues: the federal government. White working-class evangelicals are also more likely than others to blame the federal government for the economic problems facing the working class.\n\n\"I don't think that either candidate is taking Christian values into consideration,\" said Sandra Long, an 80-year-old lifelong Democrat. \"Neither one of them is acting very Christian-like. Just a lot of things are said and done. It scares me.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Feeling helpless in WV: 'We are the forgotten tribe' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Feeling helpless in WV: 'We are the forgotten tribe' 04:50\n\nLong, a Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania, resident, is scared that society is becoming more secular and will be a less accepting place for people with more conservative Christian values.\n\n\"I feel the country was founded on Christian principles. They came here to get away form being persecuted for their beliefs,\" she said. \"And now, if our ministers don't marry a gay couple or refuse to marry a gay couple, they can be arrested and taken to jail.\"\n\nWhile same-sex marriage is legal, religious leaders are not required to marry gay couples.\n\nDarrell Pool, a 60-year-old from Lamar, Colorado, said he doesn't see his traditional Christian values honored by the leading candidates.\n\n\"I don't see my values shaping the election. There's just a lot of mayhem,\" he said. \"I think the values that were in the country's founding are leaving. The moral values are leaving daily.\"\n\nMany white working-class evangelicals have no confidence that either of the presidential candidates has the ability to return the country to their perception of its former glory.\n\n\"I don't know where I am,\" said Long. \"I'm so confused at this point and time. I don't believe either one of them should be in office. I don't believe either one should be running.\"\n\nSome have entertained third-party candidates.\n\n\"I'm sick to my stomach. I cannot stand Hillary (Clinton) and I can't stand Trump, so for the first time in my life, I'm thinking of voting Libertarian or not voting,\" Mitchell said.\n\nFor these voters, the lack of confidence in government is exemplified in the candidacy of Clinton, who has been in government for more than 20 years.\n\n\"If you or I would have done what she did with those emails, we'd be in jail,\" Mitchell said. \"But because she's the Democratic nominee, they don't hold politicians to the same standards that they hold the people.\"\n\nMany of the standards these voters want to see candidates follow are rooted in the Christian faith.\n\nSecurity also a concern\n\nBut values aren't the only concerns of these voters. National security is also a major issue to many of these voters, many of whom have personal connections to the military.\n\n\"All these refugees they want to bring in, that's really got me going,\" said Pool, who participated in the survey. \"They have no idea who they're bringing in and we just keep having more attacks here.\"\n\n\"I just think it's ludicrous and all it's for is so one party can have more voters,\" he said.\n\nThe relationship between evangelicals and the refugee issue is a complicated one. Some of the biggest critics of Trump's proposed Muslim ban have been evangelicals. Christian organizations have been among the most active in helping resettle refugees, but that doesn't mean some among their flock aren't anxious.\n\nThe majority -- 75% -- of white working-class evangelicals believe that recent immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US, a higher percentage than other working-class whites.\n\n\"I say let's quit bringing these people in, period,\" Pool said. \"I realize America is a melting pot and that's how America started in the first place, but we have a process here. Nobody says you can't come to this country. Come on in. Let's do it the right way.\"",

                  "TEXT": "Harare (CNN) A prominent critic of President Robert Mugabe is facing 20 years in jail if convicted of multiple counts of subverting Zimbabwe's government.\n\nAfter posting a series of videos calling on Zimbabweans to demonstrate against fuel shortages and sudden price hikes, Pastor Evan Mawarire was arrested Sunday.\n\nIn a court appearance Monday, Mawarire pleaded not guilty to subversion charges launched against him in February. He is scheduled to appear in court again on Tuesday regarding Sunday's charges.\n\nThe videos helped ignite the largest protests in several years in the once prosperous southern African country.\n\nOn July 12, 2016, Mawarire was first detained by police for \"inciting public violence\" -- a count that was subsequently amended to a much more serious charge of subversion -- but was released the next day under immense public pressure, when the court ruled the police had violated his rights.\n\nThe pastor fled the country, fearing for his life, spending six months in self-imposed exile in the United States. On his return to Harare in February, he was immediately arrested and again charged with subversion.\n\nOn Saturday, the US embassy in Harare issued a statement asking Mugabe's government to ensure Mawarire's fair trial in the case that came out of the February arrest.\n\n\"The United States is monitoring the trial of Pastor Evan Mawarire, and calls for an end to arbitrary arrests and intimidation for political purposes. We support freedom of expression and the right of peaceful assembly. We call on the Government of Zimbabwe to respect and to protect the human rights of all persons in Zimbabwe, consistent with international human rights norms,\" said David McGuire, the spokesman for the US Embassy in Harare.\n\nMugabe has called the pastor a fake, and said he was \"foreign-sponsored.\"\n\nBefore his most recent arrest, Mawarire tweeted, \"I'm just about to finish preaching and I'm told the police are waiting outside.\"\n\nI'm just about to finish preaching and I'm told the police are waiting for me outside — #ThisFlag E Mawarire (@PastorEvanLive) September 24, 2017\n\nInside the church, Mawarire told his congregants: \"Zimbabwe, you will be free. There is no bondage or operation that will hold you back. We will not fear anybody. They (police) are outside here. They are waiting. I will not be afraid. I will not be put into fear. I will go outside now and see where this will lead us. I do not know what will happen.\"",

                  "TEXT": "Ms. Soffer and Ms. Birkner found the emotional and psychological support resources for people in their early adult life-stage lacking. “I went to a family of homicide victims support group run through Safe Horizons in a church basement in Harlem when I was living on the Upper West Side and there was no one in my generation,” said Ms. Birkner, a Brooklyn-based writer and editor. “Still, it did save my life.” Ms. Soffer said she was the only person under 65 at the grief support groups she joined, adding that among those her own age, “I barely know anyone who had lost both their parents.”\n\nFor a generation known for broadcasting internal monologue across the Internet, some of its members seem eager for spaces to express not just the good stuff that litters everyone’s Facebook newsfeed, but also the painful. In November, Melissa Lafsky Wall, 35, the founder of New York-based Brick Wall Media, turned to Modern Loss after a miscarriage, posting an essay called “The Silent Sorrow.” “The Internet should speak to the parts of life that we all experience, but aren’t represented in most media, a large one being grief and loss,” Ms. Wall said, adding that the feedback she got was all positive, which she attributes to the site. “If you are going to write about your miscarriage on Reddit, for instance, it’s going to be a very different community.”\n\nModern Loss is a repository of essays, resources and advice that the founders try to edit so that it doesn’t sound glib, overly religious or trite. For instance, you’ll never hear, “At least they are in a better place.” (“Our least favorite line ever,” Ms. Soffer said.) The website also examines decidedly 21st century topics like what to do when Gmail keeps suggesting someone who has died as a contact, a topic that Esther D. Kustanowitz, the founder of the blog My Urban Kvetch, explored in a post called “Deleting My Mother.” Befitting the target audience, it is not overly earnest. “Stay tuned for upcoming Modern Loss events in real life,” the site’s “about us” page says. “Because misery loves company, and nachos. And margaritas.”\n\nMs. Soffer, a former producer at “The Colbert Report,” said of the site, “You have to have a sense of humor.”\n\nAnother mourning site speaking to the younger generation is Lisa Frank Mixtape, promising “90s Music, 21st Century Grief.” Its founder, Zoe Feldman, 29, solicits essays about human loss (sorry, no pets), sending her contributors a mix tape in return for submitting an essay about a human loss they have experienced. Named after the company Lisa Frank, known for its brightly colored products that Ms. Feldman said are to her the antithesis of grief, the venture was inspired after her former girlfriend and Smith College classmate, Rebecca Rosenthal, known as Becca, died in October 2012 at age 27.\n\n“I went to a Shaman, a healer and every psychiatrist in Manhattan, and the only thing that helped me was talking to people my age who had experienced some devastating loss,” said Ms. Feldman, who works on business strategy for PepsiCo in New York and has mailed around 50 mixtape cassettes (she will burn a CD for those who don’t have a tape player). “One person wrote and said it’s like being part of a weird, sad tribe,” she said.\n\nThose who are accustomed to social media as a way to tout how fabulous your life is, beware: these sites can be unflinchingly graphic and wrenching. In November, K. H. (submitters use their initials on Lisa Frank Mixtape) wrote, “My dad passed away on May 31, 2003 in my arms as I tried to give him CPR.”\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Doughty, the author of a forthcoming book “Smoke Gets In Your Eyes: And Other Lessons From the Crematory,” to be published by W. W. Norton in September, said she is seeing a cultural shift happening around what she calls “death awareness.” Her peers are engaging in more-open and public discussions about mortality and loss, a movement of which her “Ask a Mortician” channel on YouTube is on the frontier.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe series has received over a million views since 2011, fielding questions such as: “How do you become a mortician?” (Go to mortuary school) and “Can you bake cremated remains into a chocolate cake?” (Yes, but it’s kind of gross.) On Ms. Doughty’s blog, contributors discuss issues like, “What do dead bodies really look like?” and “Suicide is the cause of death. Do you share?”\n\nMeanwhile, “Girls,” the HBO show about young people making their way in modern-day Brooklyn, has twice tackled the issue of grief and death this season, first when Hannah Horvath’s e-book editor, David, is found dead in the Hudson River. “Do you happen to know another publisher that I could maybe slip the manuscript to if I decide that I really want to try to keep it alive?” Ms. Horvath asks her editor’s widow at his funeral. (She promptly tells Hannah, using an expletive, to leave the reception; the protagonist seems to become more sensitive later in the season, when her grandmother dies.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe show also highlighted how the Internet has made grief more public and casual, and therefore more fraught. “Why aren’t you mourning quietly?” asks Adam, Hannah’s boyfriend, after she reads him a part of her editor’s obituary on Gawker, which in real life has a tag called “And Now They’re Dead.” Twitter responses to death, like the hashtag RIP, which was widely used after the news of the fashion designer L’Wren Scott’s suicide, can also seem more like display than distress.\n\nMs. Birkner, a former obituary writer, said: “It’s not the nature of social media, generally, to react thoughtfully to things and think, ‘How can I really help?’ It would be great if everyone said, ‘Can I buy your groceries, or can I start a meal train?’ ”\n\nLast February, on what would have been Ms. Rosenthal’s 28th birthday, Ms. Feldman found a long post on her dead friend’s Facebook wall from another friend speculating about how Ms. Rosenthal had died. “A lot of what she wrote wasn’t true,” Ms. Feldman said. “Becca’s mother was so upset, and I spent the whole day trying to do crisis management.” Ms. Feldman’s explanation for that kind of behavior is “performative grief,” she said, adding: “That’s the only excuse I can think of. The nature of the Internet allows for that sort of self-indulgent, ‘look at me’ behavior.” On the other hand, Ms. Birkner said she found support on Facebook on long-forgotten death anniversaries.\n\n“It’s such a push-pull around the pros of allowing for a sense of community that the Internet builds and the distancing that it allows from having to personally interact with others, ” said Heather Servaty-Seib, a professor at Purdue in the field of thanatology, the study of death and dying, with an emphasis on adolescent grief.\n\nThen there’s the lingua franca of social media — the like button — that’s totally discordant with death. “My God, is there anything creepier than a post announcing someone lost a loved one and seeing ‘136 people like this’ underneath?” Ms. Soffer said. Facebook floated the idea of a “sympathize button,” something that came out of its annual hackathon, but has no plans to pursue it, according to the company. (Facebook does offer an option to memorialize an account that prevents anyone from logging into it in the future, but allows friends and family, depending on privacy setting, to leave posts on the timeline.)\n\nThe fact that the Internet is perhaps not the best channel for grief (with gaffes immortalized in cyberspace) is why David Fajgenbaum, 28, the founder of National Students of AMF, a support network for college students with sick or deceased parents, said his organization of 40 chapters on campuses has been cautious about integrating an online component. “Someone could say the wrong thing online, and could really hurt someone,” said Mr. Fajgenbaum, who started the support group in his mother’s memory while an undergraduate at Georgetown.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMiss Manners, a.k.a. Judith Martin, writes rather unequivocally on the matter. “Letters of condolence should be written by hand,” she said. “Burdensome as it may be, it offers the comfort of knowing that one is representing the deceased to those who cared about him.”\n\nBut as Mr. Fajgenbaum acknowledged, young people are eager for that virtual connection; after all, technology and the Internet are a ubiquitous part of their existence. That’s what Jason Feifer, 33, creator of the instantly viral Tumblr “Selfies at Funerals,” discovered when he posted a few dozen photos of teenagers taking pictures of themselves at funerals. In doing so, Mr. Feifer, an editor at Fast Company magazine, said he was documenting a newfangled mourning practice. “It’s important for the older generation to see more than disrespect and to see some kind of genuine communication,” he said.\n\nAdmittedly, though, some of the images made him cringe, in particular the young woman who wrote: “Love my hair today. Hate why I’m dressed up #funeral.”\n\nMr. Feifer said, “I think there are a lot of kids who saw this Tumblr and will not take a selfie at a funeral, but it doesn’t mean that the kids who did take these photos don’t know how to grieve.”",

                  "TEXT": "Story highlights Rebecca Jackson-Artis: My aunt was the first black Playboy centerfold\n\nHugh Hefner gave her and other black women a platform to express revolutionary ideas about their sexuality, she writes\n\nRebecca Jackson-Artis is an actor, writer and comedian. She created and produces a web series called In The Midst of Morons. She earned a bachelor of arts degree in theatre arts/speech communications from Hampton University and is an MFA candidate in screenwriting at the University of Georgia Grady College of Journalism & Mass Communications. The views expressed in this commentary are solely the author's.\n\n(CNN) When I read that Hugh Hefner had passed away, I was immediately transported to the spring of 1991 in my Aunt Linda's kitchen on Chicago's South Side, surrounded by my dad's sisters, Jennifer, Janis, and, of course, Linda. My mom stood on the side watching them congratulate me on getting my period while the men of our family were in another room far away from us arguing about politics.\n\nStanding in that '90s kitchen with African art all around me, my aunts hugged and kissed me while enthusiastically informing me that I was now a young woman in their eyes who needed to know how to advocate for my beauty, my femininity and the legacy that was left to me. I was 13 and in the eighth grade, preparing to attend a Catholic all-girls high school on the mostly-white North Side that fall, close to my suburban home which was also surrounded by even more white people.\n\nRebecca Jackson-Artis\n\nI wasn't quite sure what they meant at the time, but it turned out they were planting seeds they'd prepared for years. You see, my aunts weren't just the typical black women who held the black community together, they were also trailblazers of black femininity. For the next eight years -- through high school and college -- they would open my mind and help me find my way through years of self-doubt, self-hate and sexual repression fed by religious dogma.\n\nHugh Hefner created a platform for revolutionary women like my aunts to express their progressive ideas about feminine leadership. My Aunt Jennifer was the first black Playboy centerfold in March of 1965, just days after the assassination of El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, also known as Malcolm X. The minute I learned of her place in black history -- or as I like to think of it, black \"herstory\" -- I realized I come from women who are unapologetically self-confident about their bodies; even now, in their 70s, my aunts exude confidence about their beauty and femininity. My Aunt Janis, Jennifer's identical twin sister, told me she worked at The Playboy Club with Jennifer to put herself through college to earn a degree. My Aunt Linda, along with my mother, Antoinette Jackson, talked about their roles in the black liberation movement in the 1960s and 1970s, wearing Afros and raising their fists as activists on behalf of black people.\n\nPlayboy didn't help my aunts gain confidence -- and that is something my aunts emphasized to me. They already had that. Playboy opened doors of opportunity for women like them, with revolutionary minds and who valued revolutionary philosophies, so those women could benefit professionally by working in an environment with resourceful men. To share with extremely successful entertainers and innovative businessmen their ideas and career paths created avenues for them which wouldn't have been available outside of those walls in those days. They also recalled that a majority of the men who came to The Playboy Club in Chicago where they worked did so as much -- or more -- to see and be seen by the other powerful and successful men as they did to ogle the women. So, I never saw Playboy as regressive. I saw it as progressive in a way, knowing the politically-minded women my aunts were and still are.\n\nRead More",

                  "TEXT": "Bobbi Young holds a photo of her mother, Marilyn Young, the day after she passed away at home in Carmel Valley, California.\n\n(CNN) I scanned my mother's bed, pulled back the rumpled sheets and uncovered her shivering naked body. I stared at her bruised inner thighs, her sheets wet with urine and blood, her catheter pulled completely out of her. I covered her with a blanket and held her close as she pleaded, \"Get me out of here.\"\n\nI kissed her forehead, our tears mixing, and promised no one was going to stop me. She would not spend another night in this nursing home.\n\nI pushed the call button. No response. I followed the cord to the wall and found it disconnected. My heart racing, I tracked down an aide and demanded that a nurse come to my mother's room immediately. At 88, she was examined with nonchalance and covered back up.\n\nI called the manager to her room and told her I was taking Mom home.\n\nThe nursing staff gathered in force, attempting to convince me that her release was a long process, that my mother could still benefit from their help. Her stay in the nursing home had been a temporary transition needed after being hospitalized with a stroke.\n\nBut I knew my mother had been harmed. I feared the worse. And I feared for her life if she stayed there.\n\nI called her doctor to sign a release form, and I phoned a service for private medical transport. I also called my husband and said, \"I need to bring Mom home with us today. Go get Daddy.\"\n\nAt the front door of the nursing home, the management staff lined up to wish us well. They invited us to come back and visit.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I told them, \"but we will never drive by this road again.\"\n\nWhen we arrived home, the driver unloaded my bundled mother and the rain momentarily stopped. I looked up and saw my father, his hand pressed to the window, tears in his eyes and mouthing the words \"Mama ... Mama's home.\" Married 69 years, my parents experienced every second apart as an eternity.\n\nOnce settled in their own bed, Daddy curled up next to Mother, held her hand, prayed with her, assured her she was OK now, home safe. She was still recovering from her stroke, and even though my father sensed some harm had come to her, he didn't ask. He didn't want to stress her more. He never left her side.\n\nMedical equipment, photos of happier times and leftover Christmas decorations fill Marilyn Young's bedroom.\n\nOver the weeks that followed, my mother complained of pain in her groin area. Doctors increased the doses of pain medication, but she still awoke in anguish, day after day. I finally had to examine her -- and my heart sank.\n\nI knew she needed to be seen by her gynecologist as soon as possible.\n\nA nurse practitioner examined my mother and ran tests to confirm her suspicions: a sexually transmitted disease. Had my mother shown these symptoms before, she asked. The answer was no. Had my mother had any sexual partners besides my father in her lifetime? The answer was no.\n\nWhen I told her about what had happened in the nursing home, the nurse said my father would need to be tested for the disease. My mother was visibly shaken. I asked the nurse, if my father was negative, what would be the next step? She said, you need to call the California Department of Public Health and file a report.\n\nWe drove home silently. My mind struggled with how much my mother had been through; now we were minutes away from devastating my father. I asked if she wanted my help in telling Daddy. The answer was yes.\n\nAs I spoke, Daddy didn't hesitate to agree to be tested. Then he asked what all of this meant. What would proving he was negative for the disease mean?\n\nMama, her voice choked with sadness, replied: \"I was raped.\"\n\nMy father held my mother, crying, shaking his head in disbelief and apologizing for not being able to keep her safe.\n\nI grew up believing my parents were strong and took comfort trusting I would always be safe. They both worked two or three jobs throughout my childhood to buy me and my siblings encyclopedias to enhance our knowledge of the world long before Google existed.\n\nWitnessing this wound inflicted on my parents cut deeply to the core of my own foundation. The hospital had recommended the nursing home as a transitional step; her own internist was the director of the facility: What could possibly go wrong?\n\nThere were no warning flags. We failed to protect her against something we could not even imagine existed. A distress signal is only as good as the person who sees it. When I saw it, I took action. But it was too late.\n\nFor months, my parents comforted each other, not wanting to be even a foot apart. Their love never wavered; it only deepened. I would walk past their bedroom and see them snuggled tightly together, whispering. My father later told me they were praying and planning to renew their wedding vows on their 70th anniversary.\n\nBeyond the harm the perpetrator had inflicted on my mother, he took a toll on my father's remaining strength and stole some of the precious time my parents had left. Still, together they decided to fight for reform, which my husband and I fully supported. We filed a civil lawsuit against the facility, arguing that more should have been done to protect my mother. She was brave enough to appear at the center of a public service video created by a nonprofit calling for nursing home reform.\n\nAfter taking her mother into her own home, Bobbi Young cared for her until Marilyn passed away in January.\n\nTwo months before my father passed away at 95, he told my mother his time was near and asked my husband and I to help them renew their vows early. They exchanged their promises tearfully and glowed with renewed divinity. He did not live long enough to see my mother receive a settlement in her case against the nursing home.\n\nOn the day my father died, my husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer. His painful journey ended 17 months later. But our commitment to choose love and joy enabled Mother and I to embrace our faith and carry on. I promised my husband I would not be sad or bitter. I had promised my father I would care for Mama and keep her safe.\n\nI feared that I would not be able to fulfill those promises.\n\nBut there are moments in life that transcend fear. They mend twisted hearts. This became one of those moments.\n\nAfter my husband's funeral, all of my mother's nurturing traits intensified. I had promised to care for her, and now she was providing me with what felt like a second childhood. She took the reins, suggesting remedies such as extra locks on doors and an alarm system to quiet our fears. She reminded me of recipes to help stretch our dollars to survive -- such as making \"imagination cookies.\" When I looked sad, she would talk about funny things my husband did to make her laugh. We prayed together, planned our spring garden, went for drives on hot days with the windows down, hair blowing in the wind, laughing with memories.\n\nI promised my mother I would honor her vow to carry on her courageous battle for justice all the days of my life by telling her story. While her perpetrator will likely never be found, it was one of her last wishes for people to understand that no one is too old to become a victim of rape.\n\nMy mother died in January. She was 94. As I walk around my home now, I look at the empty rocking chair in which she soothed her children. I can feel her brushing my long hair. The seedlings she planted in eggshells on Christmas Day are bursting toward spring. I can hear her laughter and her reminder to me: \"The gifts God gave you, he did not give to another; respect them and share them wisely. ...\"\n\nWho was this woman in my life? Why was she made to suffer so?\n\nAn answer fills my sorrowful heart:\n\nSuffering can carve two types of people, monsters and angels. I am fortunate to have been raised by angels. And I pray to one day be worthy of that divine fabric that still holds me tightly together -- love.\n\nEditor's note: Bobbi Young lives in Carmel Valley, California, where she cared for her mother during her final days.

                  "TEXT": "What influences the appearance and character of the things that surround us? Design. It might be the biggest subject in the world.\n\nDesign\n\nDesign is a defining activity of contemporary life. Like movies and rock, it is unique to contemporary civilization. Indeed, Karl Marx knew that the epic activities of the world involve not weapons, but dry goods. Then again, weapons have been designed. Still, most of us care more about our kitchen than about the Battle of Stalingrad.\n\nAnd the very best designs change things forever. But what is it? Design may be important, but is also muddled. Thirty years ago someone decided that expensively branded carbonated H 2 0 was \"designer water\" and the word seemed consigned to semantic oblivion, as toxic as \"celebrity\".\n\nThe problem is, design is not one subject, but several. Through familiarity, mis-use and abuse the word has been attenuated to a condition of near meaninglessness. For example, people often say \"everything has been designed\". That may be true: chairs, cars and buildings do not come into existence by accident, but if so it robs the concept of any lingering trace of meaning. That must mean everyone is a designer. It can't be so. As Jonathan Ive of Apple, the most valuable designer in the world today, says, design is about that special care and attention that go into successful products.\n\nThe English word comes from the Italian disegno which means drawing, but in both languages it means \"intention\" as well. Design is drawing with a purpose. It is about making ordinary things more practical, but more beautiful too.\n\nBut although the idea may go back to the Renaissance, our contemporary notion of design is a result of the Industrial Revolution, when mass-production made the multiplication of ideas a reality and consumer culture replaced high culture as the dominant force in human affairs.\n\nDesign has its place in the history of other grand innovations in human opportunity. First, the systematic Organization of Thought which began with Gutenberg's movable type of 1450 and developed into Claude Shannon's Information Theory of 1948 which made the computer age possible.\n\nSecond, the Industrialization of Energy, starting with Newcomen's very first \"engine\" of 1712 and evolving into Nikola Tesla's AC current of 1888 where, for the very first time, power could be distributed away from its source.\n\nThird, Consumer Desire. As soon as any economy passes subsistence, as the West's did in the nineteenth century, people buy things not to survive, but to express themselves: want overtakes need.\n\nA part of the designer's task is to deal with needs and anticipate wants. Design has to be practical, but there must be poetry and vision too. Gazing at the miracle that was the Citroen DS at the 1955 Salon de l'Automobile in Paris, the philosopher Roland Barthes sighed that it was \"the best messenger of a world superior to Nature\". You could say that design is just that: an artificial culture that makes good the deficiencies of the natural world. Nature never designed a suitcase.\n\nDesign is not the same as technological innovation: when the Wright Brothers took off in 1903, it was aeronautics. Nor is design to be confused with inspired invention: Laszlo Biro's ballpoint pen was the result of restless tinkering and a peculiar fascination with oil-based ink. But what designers do is interpret technology and inventions, making them useful and attractive to consumers. Thus, an exuberant pink Cadillac of 1959 might be dubious as a technological exercise and certainly employed no inventions, but as an exercise in consumer design it was supreme.\n\nUltimately, design make us feel good about ourselves and our world. The great designs dignify existence and confirm, if confirmation were needed, that life is more than a temporary conjunction of hydrocarbons in the relativist chaos of a terrifying Universe with its nasty Black Holes.\n\nLe Corbusier declared that design is \"intelligence made visible\". That's certainly true, but intelligence can take many forms...",

                  "TEXT": "(CNN) Danelle Umstead can't see when she skis down a mountain.\n\nInstead, the visually impaired alpine ski racer relies on her husband and guide, Rob, to get her down safely.\n\n\"The fear does creep into your mind and into your heart,\" said Umstead, who competes on the US Paralympic Team. \"You just have to use that mental training and harness that inner strength and let it go.\"\n\nSkiing changed her life\n\nUmstead grew up with low vision and wore thick Coke-bottle glasses to see. Her vision got worse at 13 when she was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative disease.\n\n\"I lost all usable vision in my right eye,\" she said. \"It was really tough growing up and getting involved in sports.\"\n\nOver time, her vision continued to deteriorate. By 27, Umstead lost central vision in her left eye and fell into a deep depression.\n\n\"It seemed like my life was just crumbling day by day,\" she said. \"I spent a long time feeling like there was not an easy way out or a way out at all.\"\n\nThrough this difficult time, her dad called her up.\n\n\"He said, 'We're gonna go skiing. ... I'm gonna be your eyes, and you and I are gonna go skiing,' \" she said. \"We went down the mountain, and my life changed from that moment forward.\"\n\nUmstead fell in love with the sport and moved to Taos, New Mexico, to ski as much as she could. It was there that she met Rob.\n\n\"I knew from the moment I met him that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him,\" she said.\n\nRob became her full-time guide on the slopes. He skis in front of her, calling the commands.\n\n\"I'm basically thinking out loud and telling her everything that is happening,\" he said. \"I'm telling her when I'm starting my turn, when I'm finishing my turn; I'm describing the terrain and changes in the course.\"\n\nThey wear Bluetooth headsets in their helmets to communicate on the mountain.\n\n\"We've learned a lot through skiing. I've learned how to trust. I've learned how to communicate,\" she said. \"We ski up to 70 miles per hour ... so I'm 100 percent relying on my husband.\"\n\nRoad to the Paralympics\n\nAfter getting married, the Umsteads trained hard to make the national Paralympic team. In 2010, they captured two bronze medals in the women's downhill and super combined events for the visually impaired at the Paralympics Winter Games in Vancouver.\n\nPhotos: Blind skier puts her life in her husband's hands Visually impaired US Paralympic alpine skier Danelle Umstead completely relies on her guide, husband Rob, to direct her down the slopes.

Hide Caption 9 of 9\n\nBut later that year, she faced another medical setback after a training session in Colorado.\n\n\"I woke up the next morning, and I couldn't feel anything on the right side from my rib cage all the way to my foot,\" she said.\n\nRob took her to the hospital, and they found out she has multiple sclerosis.\n\n\"I had to learn how to walk again; I had to learn how to jog again; I had to learn how to do sit-ups again,\" she said. \"It put a big wrench in our skiing career, but it put a big strength in our love and my trust and all that my husband has to offer.\"\n\nRob was with her every step of the way as she worked with a team of experts, including neurologists and physical therapists, to fight her way back to the sport. She was determined to get back on snow.\n\n\"I didn't start living my life until I started sport. And sport has given me the life that I love and enjoy,\" she said. \"So why wouldn't I fight to get that back?\"\n\nDespite the diagnosis, Danelle, now 44, and Rob captured another bronze medal in the super combined event at the 2014 Paralympic Winter Games in Sochi, Russia. And they've got their sights set on the 2018 Games in South Korea.\n\n\"My biggest goal is to bring my son and my father, who introduced me to the sport, to the Games,\" she said. \"That would be a gold medal for me.\"\n\nTell us your story Tell us your story\n\nWe love to hear from our audience. Follow @CNNHealth on Twitter and Facebook for the latest health news and let us know what we're missing.\n\nThrough it all, Umstead said, skiing has made her marriage stronger.\n\n\"Every day is different. Every course is different. Our communication changes, terrain changes,\" she said. \"It's scary. But I like it, and I wouldn't want to do it with anybody else.\"\n\nShe also hopes her story will inspire others.\n\n\"I've had many situations in my life where I have given up,\" she said. \"I've had to learn to believe in myself so the rest would fall into place.\"",

                  "TEXT": "(CNN) German Chancellor Angela Merkel has agreed to aim for a limit on Germany's refugee intake, marking a significant retreat from her previous rejection of a cap.\n\nMerkel made the announcement Monday in a joint news conference with Horst Seehofer, leader of the Christian Social Union -- the more conservative sister party to Merkel's Christian Democratic Union -- after discussions in which the two parties sought compromises on a number of issues following poor results in the federal elections two weeks ago.\n\nThe parties have agreed to try and limit the number of refugees arriving in Germany each year to 200,000 -- a policy that Seehofer has repeatedly demanded and Merkel had consistently rejected.\n\n\"On the issue of an upper limit, my position is clear,\" Merkel said in July. \"I won't accept one.\"\n\nNearly three months later, that position has changed. \"I'm pleased about the compromise we've found,\" she said Monday, describing the deal as a \"very, very good basis\" for the two parties to enter coalition talks next week.\n\n2015 'cannot be repeated'\n\nThe new policy is not described as an upper limit (\"Obergrenze\") and comes with several caveats, but still marks a concession by Merkel to the more conservative forces in her sister party.\n\n\"We will continue our efforts to reduce, sustainably and permanently, the number of people who flee to Germany and Europe, so that a situation like that of 2015 will not and cannot be repeated,\" reads a joint CSU/CDU position paper published Monday . \"We guarantee that.\"\n\nMore than a million refugees entered the country in 2015 as a result of Merkel's so-called open-door migration policy, sparking a heated national debate about immigration and integration.\n\nSeehofer has strongly criticized Merkel for allowing over a million refugees into Germany in 2015.\n\nThe 200,000 figure refers to controlled admissions, such as refugees resettled as part of EU programs or under the deal struck between the bloc and Turkey in 2016.\n\nReducing the number of asylum seekers who arrive outside the framework of these programs can be achieved by fighting traffickers, protecting the EU's borders and striking deals with countries of origin and transit, according to the document.\n\nMerkel and Seehofer made clear Monday that the figure itself is flexible -- the Bundestag can decide to raise or lower it in extreme circumstances -- and the fundamental right to seek asylum is guaranteed: People will not be turned away at the borders after the limit is reached.\n\n'Regressive' policies\n\nBut Karl Kopp, director for European affairs at Pro Asyl , a German charity that advocates for refugees, told CNN that any kind of limit is \"not compatible with international law\" and \"totally unacceptable.\"\n\nHe's also concerned that a further proposal to house all asylum seekers in \"decision and repatriation centers\" while their claims are assessed will be detrimental for the integration process and encourage hostility toward refugees.\n\nKopp sees these \"regressive\" announcements as a direct response to the success of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in last month's election.\n\nThe party, which campaigned on an anti-Islam, anti-immigration platform, won 12.6% of the vote and is now the third largest party in Parliament.\n\nAlice Weidel and Alexander Gauland, co-lead candidates of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) celebrate after the announcement of the initial results of the federal election on September 24\n\nAcross Europe, far-right parties have \"hijacked the agenda,\" Kopp said. Discussions about migration in Germany are now \"inspired by the right wing and the AfD. It's a poisoned debate.\"\n\nOn the night of the election, Merkel described the AfD's success as a \"big new challenge\" and said she wanted to \"win back AfD voters.\"\n\nThis new position may be an attempt to do just that. Although Merkel's party won the biggest share of the vote in the country's federal elections two weeks ago -- propelling her to a fourth term in office -- support for her party fell by 8.6 percentage points, with many voters turning to the AfD instead.\n\nIt is unclear whether this move will encourage those voters to shift their allegiance back to the CDU, but it is likely to cause problems for Merkel during coalition discussions. The Green party is committed to fighting any kind of limit on refugee numbers and reiterated that position Sunday night.\n\nUnd wo ist da der Unterschied zur #Obergrenze? Zahl ist völlig beliebig, also rein ideologisch festgelegt. Für uns gilt Grundrecht auf Asyl! https://t.co/J3FapZJ4aD — Simone Peter (@peter_simone) October 8, 2017\n\nIn a post on Twitter, Simone Peter, co-leader of the party, insisted there was no difference between this agreement and Seehofer's earlier demands for an \"Obergrenze.\"\n\n\"And where is the difference with an upper limit?\" Peter wrote. \"Number is totally arbitrary, determined purely ideologically. For us it's the basic right to asylum that matters!\"",

The video eventually racked up more than 59,000 views and 17,000 comments over the next three days. And while not all the comments were mean-spirited, the fitness pro was quick to defend herself from the ones that were.\n\nCROSSFIT MOM DOES ADORABLE WORKOUT WITH HER 6-MONTH-OLD BABY\n\n“I’m a bit thick, for sure. But fat? Really guys?” she wrote in a blog post.\n\n“The majority of mainstream media, with a few recent exceptions, has made us believe that to be fit means to be thin and ‘toned,’” Gaines told The Daily Meal. “While we're starting to see a shift in that mindset, the comments made during the workout were a reminder that we have a ways to go.”\n\nShe’s not wrong. Medical experts have long noted that a thin frame doesn’t necessarily indicate good health, nor does a thicker frame indicate poor wellness habits.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n“It’s up to us as fitness and health professionals to make an active effort to remind ourselves and others of that,” Gaines added.",

                  "TEXT": "Jemele Hill, the controversial ESPN anchor who called for fans to boycott the NFL after labeling President Trump a “white supremacist” on Twitter, has been suspended for two weeks by the network.\n\nHill violated the company’s social media guidelines a second time, according to ESPN, after she called on fans to take indirect action against the Dallas Cowboys after owner Jerry Jones told players they would be benched if they didn't stand up during the national anthem.\n\n“Change happens when advertisers are impacted,” Hill wrote. “If you strongly reject what Jerry Jones said, the key is his advertisers.”\n\nHill wasn’t formally punished for mocking Trump on Twitter, but ESPN took action when she called for fans to boycott the Cowboys’ advertisers.\n\n“Jemele Hill has been suspended for two weeks for a second violation of our social media guidelines. She previously acknowledged letting her colleagues and company down with an impulsive tweet. In the aftermath, all employees were reminded of how much individual tweets may reflect negatively on ESPN and that such action would have consequences. Hence this decision,” an ESPN spokesman said in a statement.\n\nIn response, Hill's co-host on “SC6,” Michael Smith, chose to sit out Monday night's broadcast, in a “mutual” decision with ESPN, The Wrap reported.\n\nOther supporters of Hill said they were outraged. Rev. Al Sharpton said the suspension “should NOT go unanswered. ESPN and advertisers will hear from us!”\n\nRosie O'Donnell tweeted “We are with you,” adding the hashtag #systemicRACISM.\n\n\"Jemele Hill has been suspended for two weeks for a second violation of our social media guidelines. She previously acknowledged letting her colleagues and company down with an impulsive tweet.\" - ESPN spokesman\n\nJones issued his edict before the Cowboys' game Sunday against the Green Bay Packers. It came after amid a backlash against players “taking a knee” during the national anthem, driven in part by President Trump's angry denouncement of what some players called legitimate social protest.\n\n“I know this, we cannot ... in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag,” Jones said. “We know that there is a serious debate in this country about those issues, but there is no question in my mind that the National Football League and the Dallas Cowboys are going to stand up for the flag. So we're clear.”\n\nJones’ comments, the strongest made on the anthem controversy, came after he was asked about Vice President Mike Pence leaving the game in Indianapolis early after several San Francisco 49ers players took a knee during the national anthem. Hill, an outspoken liberal, tweeted that Jones “has created a problem for his players, specifically the black ones… If they don't kneel, some will see them as sellouts.”\n\nThe ESPN host wrote, “By drawing a line in the sand, Jerry put his players under more scrutiny and threw them under the bus... If the rationale behind JJ's stance is keeping the fanbase happy, make him see that he is underestimated how all of his fanbase feels.”\n\nShe urged “paying customers” to “boycott his advertisers” if they didn’t agree with Jones’ comments. Hill quoted a list of Cowboys’ advertisers in one of her tweets and sent a message to her 760,000-plus Twitter followers.\n\nESPN, the network that employs Hill, agreed to pay $15.2 billion in 2011 to air the NFL’s “Monday Night Football,” according to The New York Times. The NFL and its content are obviously extremely valuable to ESPN and Hill's latest violation will cost her two weeks of work.\n\nESPN declined comment regarding whether or not Hill will be paid during the suspension. The NFL declined comment when reached by Fox News.\n\nHill, who currently has a pair of photographs with former President Barack and Michelle Obama pinned atop her Twitter feed, co-hosts “SC6,” a relatively new version of the network’s flagship show, SportsCenter.\n\nHill was in the middle of a national story when she criticized President Trump on Twitter last month. Her tweets caught the attention of the White House and Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who said she considered the rhetoric a “fireable offense.” Trump even took to Twitter himself to mock ESPN and demand an apology.\n\n“Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has surrounded himself with other white supremacists,” Hill wrote on Sept 11. She called him “the most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime.” Hill also called Trump a “bigot,” and “unqualified and unfit to be president.” She even added: “If he were not white, he never would have been elected.”\n\nThere was speculation that ESPN wanted to sideline Hill for one episode of “SC6” as a result of the Trump tweets but her co-host, Michael Smith, refused to do the show without her. Citing “two sources familiar with the situation,” Think Progress reported last month that ESPN executives reached out to other black hosts to fill in. According to the website, ESPN scrapped the idea when two African-American ESPN hosts declined to fill in for Hill and Smith. The outspoken duo hosted the show that night. ESPN denied that it attempted to find alternative hosts.\n\nHill eventually admitted that she cried over the situation in a meeting with ESPN President John Skipper, but didn't exactly apologize to Trump or his supporters.\n\n“Since my tweets criticizing President Donald Trump exploded into a national story, the most difficult part for me has been watching ESPN become a punching bag and seeing a dumb narrative kept alive about the company’s political leanings,” Hill wrote.\n\n“It was the first time I had ever cried in a meeting. I didn’t cry because Skipper was mean or rude to me. I cried because I felt I had let him and my colleagues down,” Hill wrote in a commentary on the ESPN site The Undefeated.\n\nJones and the rest of the Cowboys kneeled arm-in-arm before the national anthem before a game against the Arizona Cardinals two weeks ago, days after Trump reignited the anthem-protest controversy with a series of tweets. Former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the Anthem last season in protest of what he believed were instances of racial injustice in the U.S. He is currently out of the league and many feel his political stance is why no team has given him an opportunity to play in 2017.\n\nBack in 2014, ESPN suspended Bill Simmons for criticizing NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. The following year his contract was not renewed by the network. Hill was also suspended nearly a decade ago when she compared Boston Celtics fans to Nazis in a blog on ESPN’s website in 2008.",

You win Lincoln Police!” one person commented.\n\n“Always good when cops can laugh and poke fun at their own stereotypes! Lol,” another person wrote.\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with the book-turned-movie, Pennywise, the child-eating clown who lives in sewers, uses the red balloons as a calling card.\n\nThe viral photo follows the viral selfie by Gainesville police officers during Hurricane Irma recovery in Florida.

                  "TEXT": "Volunteers with a passion for aviation are spending countless hours maintaining and flying one of the last Boeing B-17’s manufactured during World War II as a part of their Salute to Veterans tour across the United States.\n\nThe flying museum, better known as the “Madras Maiden” touched down in Columbia, S.C. Sunday, where volunteers give 30-minute tours to veterans, visitors or families of those who served in the military.\n\n“They do fine…I’m proud of them. [They’re] down in that plane like they were born in it,” WWII Army veteran William Pate said about the volunteers.\n\nFrom 1944 to 1947, Pate jumped out of C-47’s and C-82’s as an 82nd Airborne paratrooper.\n\n“I enjoyed what I was doing. If I could, I would do it again. But I have a lot of age on me now. I ain’t no spring chicken,” he told Fox News.\n\nPate and other veterans in attendance swapped war stories with each other and the crew after taking one of the flights over the city.\n\n“It’s just an honor to be able to hear their stories, talk to their families and just keep their memories alive for generations,” Rodney Schneider said.\n\nAn aircraft maintainer by trade, Schneider explained his love for planes stretched back to his childhood. This motivated him to reach out to the Liberty Foundation, which organizes the event.\n\n“I’ve been with the airplane now seven-days straight. Sometimes its weeks between when I’m needed,\" Schneider said.\n\nRobert “Max” Maiden, 21, is a co-pilot for the bomber. He flies to different cities every weekend for six months.\n\n“I’ve always loved flying old airplanes…They have a cool story to tell and they are an important part of history,” Maiden said. “You really see people get really emotional and they sit there and they go, 'Aww man this is what my dad did,' or ‘my dad built them’ or 'my dad flew them or is a gunner.' It’s really cool to share that with people.”\n\nErin Creed traveled to Columbia from Virginia with her father and husband to honor her grandfather, who fought the Nazis in Europe.\n\n“I just could not believe I was on a World War Two plane,” she said. “I had his picture and his favorite hat and I just couldn’t believe [I] was flying in memory of him.”\n\nOne of only 12 B-17’s still flying the “Madras Maiden” was built toward the end of the war but never saw combat. In 2016, The Liberty Foundation began operating the aircraft and spends over a million dollars every year for upkeep. The money that is generated from ticket sales or donations helps to cover the costs.\n\n“If that goes away, it goes back into a museum and starts collecting dust and you don’t get to hear it or smell it,” Schneider explained.\n\nThe crew’s age and skills may vary, but one thing remains the same -- the love for planes and veterans.\n\n“We get to ride on a WWII airplane that not everybody can do and just the satisfaction of just doing it,” Schneider said.\n\nAs a part of its tour across the U.S. the plane is scheduled to make stops in Tennessee and Kentucky.",

Veselnitskaya wrote, however, that she “had been told” Trump Jr. “could help” her bring information to members of Congress about the Magnitsky Act, which Moscow adamantly opposed.\n\nTRUMP TOWER MEETING WASN'T ABOUT CLINTON 'DIRT,' EMAILS SHOW\n\n“If Hillary Clinton or anybody from her environment could have been such an individual [to help], I also would have passed that information [to her],” Veselnitskaya wrote.\n\nThe June 2016 meeting was first reported by The New York Times over the summer, reigniting claims that the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia in the presidential election.\n\nTrump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort were known to have attended the meeting with Veselnitskaya, Russian-born lobbyist Rinat Ahkmetshin and music publicist Rob Goldstone, who brokered the get-together promising campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton.\n\nVeselnitskaya told Fox News on Wednesday that the information being shared in the Trump Tower meeting “was not confidential,” but also “was not public.” “I wanted to make it public,” Veselnitskaya said in the email. “Because I naively thought there should be justice in the US for the fraudsters fostering hatred between the two of our countries.”\n\nThe suggestion that she would have made contact with Clinton further challenges the notion that the meeting was about anything other than sanctions.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier on correspondence between Veselnitskaya and Goldstone, likewise suggesting the meeting was not set up to pass on damaging information about Clinton on behalf of the Russian government.\n\nRUSSIAN ATTORNEY RIPS ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER AS 'CHEAP GOSSIP,' AMID QUESTIONS OVER ORIGIN\n\nThe emails show Veselnitskaya requesting to invite Akhmetshin to the meeting, saying he had “invaluable knowledge about the positions held by the members of the Foreign Relations Committee that will be important to our discussion,” the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nWhile Veselnitskaya -- in correspondence at the time and comments made more recently -- has countered claims that the meeting might have dealt with Clinton dirt, that narrative emerged thanks to the originally published correspondence between Trump Jr. and Goldstone.\n\nGoldstone said at the time that he could set up a meeting to provide “very high level and sensitive information” compromising Clinton’s election chances as part of “Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”\n\n“If it’s what you say, I love it,” Trump Jr. wrote in response.\n\nIt remains unclear what Goldstone was referring to.\n\nFollowing the controversy, Trump Jr. defended himself, saying Veselnitskaya did not have any such information and wanted to focus on other non-election-related issues. She echoed his view on multiple occasions.\n\nThe emails were released by Scott Balber, an attorney for Aras Agalarov, who helped organize the meeting with Trump Jr.\n\nBalber also told the Journal that the Russian lawyer has been fighting the Magnitsky Act for years and reached out to numerous Russian authorities.\n\nAs part of her effort against the sanctions law, Veselnitskaya reportedly had talking points that included one reference to Clinton, suggesting a U.S. company had avoided taxes in Russia and donated to the Democratic Party, possibly Clinton.\n\nFox News' Lukas Mikelionis contributed to this report.",

It was all in fun.”\n\nAccording to Dr. Claire McCarthy, MD, a physician at Boston Children's Hospital and an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, Dreiling’s behavior is normal for babies learning how to crawl.\n\nHall, who says Dreiling has always been a very active baby, is just happy to have him join her in the gym – she captioned her photo with the hashtag #crossfitbaby.",

It was used to demonstrate Facebook Spaces, which allows Facebook's users to create 3-D virtual avatars of themselves, using an Oculus Rift VR headset.\n\n\"One of the things that's really magical about virtual reality, is you can get the feeling that you're really in a place,\" Zuckerberg said. Franklin followed up, saying, \"Crazy to feel like you're in the middle of it.\"\n\nFACEBOOK, GOOGLE, TWITTER: HOW TECH GIANTS ARE INVOLVED IN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION\n\nZuckerberg was lambasted in the comment section on the post. One user wrote, \"Is this a joke? The Puerto Ricans are suffering and you are using our tragedy for this?? Heartless billionaire.\"\n\nAnother wrote that Zuckerberg \"can't let a good tragedy go to waste. He has to promote Facebook. Typical. All he talks about (is) Facebook instead of victims and their suffering.\"\n\nZuckerberg responded, writing, \"One of the most powerful features of VR is empathy. My goal here was to show how VR can raise awareness and help us see what's happening in different parts of the world. I also wanted to share the news of our partnership with the Red Cross to help with the recovery. Reading some of the comments, I realize this wasn't clear, and I'm sorry to anyone this offended.\"\n\nWhen a commenter wrote that it was distracting to see avatars talking about a real natural disaster, Zuckerberg added, \"I hear that. When you're in VR yourself, the surroundings feel quite real. But that sense of empathy doesn't extend well to people watching you as a virtual character on a 2D screen. That's something we'll need to work on over time.\"\n\nOthers took to Twitter to express their dismay.\n\nFacebook and Oculus are scheduled to have a press event on Wednesday, dubbed Oculus Connect 4. Zuckerberg wrote, \"I'll be going live and announcing some of the new work we've done with the community.\" Facebook purchased Oculus for $2 billion in March 2014.\n\nFACEBOOK CEO MARK ZUCKERBERGASKS FORGIVENESS FOR WAYS HIS 'WORK WAS USED TO DIVIDE PEOPLE'\n\nAsking for forgiveness\n\nThe apology comes after the tech exec asked for forgiveness during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur for ways his \"work was used to divide people.\"\n\n\"Tonight concludes Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year for Jews when we reflect on the past year and ask forgiveness for our mistakes,” he wrote. “For those I hurt this year, I ask forgiveness and I will try to be better. For the ways my work was used to divide people rather than bring us together, I ask forgiveness and I will work to do better. May we all be better in the year ahead, and may you all be inscribed in the book of life.”\n\nMaria's aftermath\n\nLast month, Zuckerberg said that Facebook would work to \"get Puerto Rico back online\" after the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Maria, a category 4 storm, which ravaged the country. Facebook donated $1.5 million to NetHope and the World Food Programme, as well as donating ads \"to get critical information to people in the region\" and teams of facebook workers \"to deliver emergency telecommunications assistance to get the systems up and running.\"\n\nHe has also helped raise over $120,000 for Save the Children to help support the recovery of Puerto Rico.\n\nThree weeks after the storm, just over 10 percent of the island has power and roughly 33 percent of cell towers have been restored, according to the Puerto Rico government's website.\n\nFollow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia.

                  "TEXT": "President Trump openly threatened Wednesday to go after the licenses of \"NBC and the Networks,\" as he ratcheted up his complaints about \"Fake News.\"\n\n“With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!” Trump tweeted.\n\nThis was after he challenged the accuracy of an NBC News report that said he sought a “nearly tenfold increase” in the nuclear arsenal during a summer meeting.\n\n“Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a ‘tenfold’ increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction, made up to demean. NBC=CNN!” Trump tweeted Wednesday.\n\nThe president's comments reportedly came during a gathering with national security leaders. NBC reported that Trump’s comments were in response to a briefing slide that was presented showing a decrease in U.S. nuclear weapons since the late 1960s.\n\nTILLERSON BLASTS REPORT OF RIFT WITH TRUMP, AS PRESIDENT RIPS ‘FAKE NEWS’\n\n“Trump indicated he wanted a bigger stockpile, not the bottom position on that downward-sloping curve,” NBC News reported.\n\nOfficials reportedly were surprised by Trump’s suggestion, but said no expansion in the nuclear arsenal was planned.\n\nA representative for NBC News did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday, though MSNBC host Ali Velshi tweeted that the network \"stands by our reporting.\"\n\nThe president's and the government's power in this area could be limited anyway. According to the FCC’s own guidelines, the commission only licenses individual broadcast stations, not entire “TV or radio networks (such as CBS, NBC, ABC or Fox).”\n\nThis isn’t the first time the president has blasted NBC News' reporting. Just last week, the network reported on rifts between the president and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, claiming Tillerson considered resigning over the summer and once called the president a “moron.”\n\nBoth Trump and Tillerson disputed the report, which had claimed Vice President Pence even intervened to assuage Tillerson's concerns.\n\n“My commitment to the success of our president and our country is as strong as it was the day I accepted his offer to serve as secretary of state…There is much to be done, and we’re just getting started,” Tillerson said last week. “The vice president has never had to persuade me to remain as secretary of state because I have never considered leaving this post.”\n\nTrump blasted the report as “Fake News.”",

                  "TEXT": "As Florida Keys residents continue to pick up their lives after Hurricane Irma, they are still coming to grips with the fact that cleanup is nowhere near complete, but on Thursday, some of them got a visit from two well-known public figures committed to helping the region.\n\nBruce Hornsby could be heard at Key West’s Mallory Square as a “reclamation party” got underway, Thursday afternoon. The feeling was positive and the outlook was bright.\n\nHours later, Key West Mayor Craig Cates came in to Two Friends Patio Restaurant for dinner, as nearby Duval Street began to show signs of life.\n\n“Key West is going to be open for business soon,” said Cates.\n\nWhen asked about the higher volume of people out and about, the mayor replied, “Well, we’re taking visitors now. We haven’t advertised yet,” he said.\n\nCates, however, pointed out that the hardest hit parts of the Keys are still picking up the pieces from Irma’s devastation. “We understand our neighbors to the north in the Florida Keys got more damage than us,” he said.\n\nIn nearby Big Pine Key, the cleanup is still ongoing.\n\nAmong those cleaning up are 85-year-old Wes Harris and his wife. “We’ve been married 63 years,” he said.\n\nThe couple rode out the storm near their now beat-up home.\n\nThe wheelchair ramp into Harris’ home was just recently repaired by first responders, but there’s still so much more to do.\n\n“See that rock? You see how big that rock is?” Harris said as he pointed to a large boulder in his yard. “That’s not my rock. I don’t know where the hell it came from.”\n\nThe legally blind U.S. Army veteran, who suffers from spinal stenosis, lost his orchid ranch, which he says had between 7,000 and 8,000 flowers.\n\nHarris is so tough that the idea of getting a little emotional over the relief effort in the aftermath of the storm makes him annoyed.\n\n“I just can’t believe how everybody has helped. It’s absolutely unbelievable,” Harris said.\n\nHarris’ post-storm story isn’t necessarily unique. Residents told 7News about problems with their house, their boat, or in some cases, both.\n\nBig names also came to help out the Keys, in the form of former football player Tim Tebow and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.\n\n“So many people are so tough, and what they’ve gone through,” said Tebow. “You know what’s even more special? So many people, who don’t know what’s even going on with their houses, but they’re still volunteering for other people that need help.”\n\nResidents appreciated Tebow’s visit. “He’s such a huge model for me, so it’s a nice thing that he came down here to the Keys,” said one woman.\n\n7News cameras captured Rubio posing for pictures, as food, ice and relief supplies got to those in need.\n\nWhen asked what he would say to those residents who fear they may be forgotten, Rubio responded: “They won’t be forgotten by us — I don’t know if someone else will — primarily because we’ve spent a lot of time, personally, in the Keys, up and down this place. I mean my family, we’ve had so many incredible memories here. We want to see the Keys come back.”\n\nMeanwhile, Harris indicated he will make it through that strong current called adversity, probably because of his big heart. “You’ve got to keep stroking, bud. That’s all you can do,” he said.\n\nAs the reclamation party begins in Key West, many residents feel that, because the cleanup is still underway, the party is happening too soon. however, others feel that it needs to happen to show that the Florida Keys are still alive.\n\nOfficials said tourism will return to Key West in a limited capacity on Sunday with the arrival of a cruise ship at the Margaritaville Pier. It is scheduled to arrive at noon.\n\nClick here for more from WSVN.",

                  "TEXT": "FOX News’ Chris Wallace has re-signed a multi-year contract with the network, announced Jay Wallace, president of news for FOX News Channel (FNC). Wallace will remain in his role as anchor of FOX News Sunday and will continue his contributions to FNC’s programming, including all election coverage.\n\nIn making the announcement, Jay Wallace said, “Throughout his 50-plus years in broadcast journalism, Chris has established himself as one of the most esteemed journalists of our time. We are delighted to have him continue informing our viewers with his hard-hitting interviews and tough-minded reporting for years to come.”\n\nChris Wallace added, “After almost 14 years as the anchor of Fox News Sunday, I think I am starting to get the hang of it. Rupert Murdoch has asked me to stay on the beat well past the 2020 election. I am honored by his confidence, and excited to keep reporting as part of the FOX News team.”\n\nWallace currently serves as the anchor of FOX News Sunday, a one-hour live broadcast airing Sunday mornings across the nation on FOX Broadcasting Company and on later in the day on FNC. Throughout his 14 years as anchor, Wallace has interviewed numerous political heavyweights and newsmakers, including: then-President-elect Donald Trump; Vice President Mike Pence; former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush; former Vice President Dick Cheney, then-Vice President-elect Joe Biden, former U.S. Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton, Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell; and the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nDuring his tenure at FNC, Wallace has participated in coverage of nearly every major political event and has played an integral role in FOX News’ 2016, 2012, 2008 and 2004 election coverage. On October 19th, 2016, Wallace became the first journalist from FOX News to moderate a general election presidential debate, which took place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. He received notable praise from both sides of the aisle for his tough questioning of both presidential candidates at the third and final debate of the 2016 election.\n\nAdditionally, in August 2015, Wallace co-moderated the first GOP presidential debate of the 2016 election cycle, which delivered a record breaking 24 million viewers and is the most-watched non-sports cable telecast of all time. He also co-moderated the network’s second and third debates of the 2016 cycle, held on January 28th in Des Moines, IA and March 3rd in Detroit, MI.\n\nThroughout his 50-plus years of broadcast experience, Wallace has won every major broadcast news award for his reporting, including three Emmy Awards, the Dupont-Columbia Silver Baton, a Peabody Award, the Radio Television Digital News Association’s Paul White Award and the Sol Taishoff Award for Broadcast Journalism, which was bestowed on him by the National Press Foundation. Most recently, he received the 2017 International Center for Journalists Founders Award for Excellence in Journalism, which he will accept this November.\n\nA graduate of Harvard University, Wallace worked at ABC News for 14 years prior to joining FNC, where he served as the chief correspondent for Primetime Thursday and a substitute host for Nightline. During his tenure with ABC News, Wallace hosted multiple groundbreaking investigations and received numerous awards for his work. He previously served as NBC’s Chief White House correspondent from 1982-1989. While at NBC, he covered the 1980, 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns as well as the Democratic and Republican conventions in those years. Wallace moderated Meet the Press from 1987-1988, making him the only person to have hosted two Sunday talk shows. He also anchored the Sunday edition of NBC Nightly News from 1982-1984 and 1986-1987. Wallace began his career with NBC at WNBC-TV (NBC 4) in New York in 1975.\n\nFOX News Channel (FNC) is a 24-hour all-encompassing news service dedicated to delivering breaking news as well as political and business news. The number one network in cable, FNC has been the most watched television news channel for more than 15 years and according to a Suffolk University/USA Today poll, is the most trusted television news source in the country. Owned by 21st Century Fox, FNC is available in more than 90 million homes and dominates the cable news landscape, routinely notching the top ten programs in the genre.\n\n###\n\nFOX News Media Contact :\n\nCarly Shanahan/212.301.3851",

So, Burger King is rolling out a spicy chicken of its own.\n\n\"People were craving this spicy nugget. They wanted spicy nuggets,” Burger King's president Alex Macedo told Business Insider.\n\n“There's a need out there, and we have a LTO,\" or limited time offering, Macedo continued. \"We want to take advantage of this opportunity before anyone else does. So, we're going straight to the point.\"\n\nBurger King is confident in their ability to succeed where their competitors failed. So confident, that the burger joint issued a full-page advertisement in the Miami Herald, directed at people named “Wendy.”\n\n“(Yea, if your name is Wendy we’re talking to you)” the ad starts, before cheekily stating, “it sounds like you’ve been missing that spice in your life for long enough.”\n\nThe marketing ploy goes on to announce the Spicy Chicken Nugget launch, and then offer \"Wendy\" a good deal.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n“So if your name is Wendy and you live in Miami, the spice is being brought for free. Stop by any participating BURGER KING location after noon on October 13 with a valid ID and enjoyed a 10 pc. Spicy Nuggets your way,” it reads.\n\nThe chain has tried a spicy version of chicken before with a hotter version of their cult-favorite Chicken Fries. However, the “Fiery Chicken Fries” fell short on living up to their name.\n\nThe free nuggets are available to Wendys in Los Angeles, New York, and Miami. If your name isn’t Wendy, you can still try the spicy protein, but you’ll have to cough up the $1.49.",

                  "TEXT": "Will Senator Bob Corker torch tax reform? That is the speculation of the New York Times, the Washington Post and other liberal outlets. Pundits suggest that Trump’s recent Twitter battle with Corker might drive the offended Tennessee senator to vote against the White House’s proposed tax package.\n\nThat says a lot more about Bob Corker than it does about Donald Trump.\n\nJust as many think that personal animus against Trump drove John McCain to crush Republicans’ efforts to undo ObamaCare, notwithstanding the dire health care situation in the senator’s home state of Arizona, now many believe that Corker, out of pique, could topple efforts to cut taxes. That would be a staggering defection from earlier campaign promises, and a serious blow to the GOP’s pro-worker tax plan.\n\nOn the campaign trail in 2006, Corker promised to “ensure that government works with entrepreneurs and businesses, rather than against them. By reducing the burden of taxation, litigation, and regulation, American entrepreneurs will be better able to create exciting new businesses and good-paying jobs.”\n\nThat was when Corker was first running for office, and still viewed the world from his perspective as a wealthy self-made real estate developer, or, in fact, much like Donald Trump. Indeed, perhaps because of their similar backgrounds, Corker is one of the few legislators reputed to have developed a good relationship with the president. Until now, when his disdain for Trump’s muscular and unpredictable foreign policy has driven Corker to much-hyped break with The Donald.\n\nTrump is not the first to fall short of Corker’s expectations. He spent the past decade blasting President Obama’s lack of leadership, eventually writing an op-ed for the Washington Post entitled “Obama is an Unreliable Ally.” In that 2014 piece Corker wrote about Obama’s wavering on Syria, Libya, our “tepid response to Russian aggression in Ukraine” and elsewhere, concluding, “This U.S. president, despite his bold pronouncements and moral posturing, cannot be counted on.” He took Obama to task for issuing “plenty of tough statements” about Russia, but failing to follow up.\n\nIn short, he echoed Trump’s disdain for Obama’s weak-kneed overseas engagements. But now he has shifted gears, alarmed by Trump’s bellicose warnings to North Korea and threats to topple the Iran nuclear accord. Those positions are surprising in light of his 2006 campaign statements that “Iran and North Korea pose exceptional dangers because of their possession of nuclear materials and our relations with these nations should be a top foreign policy priority. We must be firm in our insistence that Iran and North Korea renounce any nuclear weapons programs and we should stay focused on solving this problem in the near term.”\n\nCorker notably has not volunteered how exactly we are supposed to do that. He helped pass the fictional agreement with Iran that presumes to put off their nuclear development, but that has gaping holes in verification, and few imagine that the mullahs will not steadily advance towards nuclear capability.\n\nMeanwhile, the only progress made in hemming in North Korea has taken place recently, under President Trump. Helped by his assertion that all options are on the table, including military, the White House has bullied the world into jointly enacting, for the first time, serious sanctions. His missile strike on Syria, carried out while entertaining Chinese President Xi Jinping, unsettled the Chinese and drove them to take his bluster seriously. Key to any success, the Chinese finally appear to be pressuring their rogue neighbor.\n\nBut Corker says Trump’s threats of military action against North Korea could put the U.S. “on the path to World War III.”\n\nWe shall see. In the meantime, Corker’s dim view of Trump’s aggression towards our enemies and erratic management style should not deter him from voting in favor of much-needed tax reform. Proposals to lighten the tax burden on corporations and small businesses are an important step towards accelerating our growth and creating more jobs.\n\nCorker has threatened to block the tax cuts, saying at a Budget Committee hearing, “Unless it reduces deficits — let me say that one more time — unless it reduces deficits and does not add to deficits with reasonable and responsible growth models, and unless we can make it permanent, I don't have any interest in it.\"\n\nGiven that there will be widely divergent estimates of how lower taxes will impact the economy and the budget deficit, Corker will have cover for however he votes. Democrats can be counted on to discount any additional growth to come from reduced taxes, which will drive up estimated revenue shortfalls. Others will forecast a more positive impact from simplifying and reducing taxes, and from encouraging corporations to invest more in the U.S.\n\nIn the past, the senator has supported measures to boost economic growth, such as those underpinning the Trump agenda – like lower taxes and lighter regulations -- which is perhaps why he was reelected in 2012. Now that he is wavering in those commitments, his popularity in his home state has plunged – to 34 percent in one recent poll, even as Trump maintains much higher approval in Tennessee. Perhaps that is why Corker will not run for reelection, and why he is so peeved at the president.\n\nMaybe that is why another poll showed 77 percent of Tennessee Republicans trust Trump, but only 40 percent have confidence in their senator.\n\nLet us hope that Corker earns back that trust by putting his personal feelings aside, and doing what’s right for the country and for Tennessee.",

The Mexican Navy tweeted a series of photos of Frida, which garnered over 8,000 likes on Twitter.\n\nOn Tuesday, Frida was sent to the Enrique Rebsamen school in Mexico City that collapsed in the earthquake.

In the video, the outlet reported that Lucy’s was honoring Putin with a five-patty burger weighing exactly 1,952 grams, a number which celebrated the year of his birth, reports The Independent.\n\nBURGER KING RUSSIA WANTS TO BAN 'IT,' CLAIMS IT ADVERTISES FOR MCDONALD'S\n\nThe segment also featured actual footage of a waitress delivering a large burger to a patron at Lucy’s, filmed inside the restaurant itself. According to The Independent, the waitress even provided details of the “Putin burger” during the clip, although the video has since been pulled by Ruptly.\n\nThe manager for Lucy’s Cantina Royale says he has no idea why this video was made, but insists that Lucy’s “disavows the statements made in the video, which are false,” according to a statement obtained by The Independent.\n\n“Lucy’s Cantina Royale was subject of a hoax involving Vladimir Putin’s birthday. Our restaurant has never celebrated Vladimir Putin’s birthday in any way, shape, or form, and has never offered a ‘Putin Burger,’” manager Tim Ryan said.\n\nHAMBURGER HELPER CLAPS BACK AT TWITTER USER OVER 'WIFE MATERIAL' COMMENT\n\nRyan was also asked if he believed the video was produced as part of a staff members' school project and somehow found its way to the Russian media outlet, but he declined to answer. He did, however, confirm that the employees who took part in the hoax “have been suspended pending investigation.”\n\nIt’s not clear how many of Lucy’s employees were suspended, but the Independent reports that the video also contained testimony from two “barmaids,” one of whom praised Putin as an “outstanding politician and political leader.“\n\nRuptly, too, has since questioned the validity of the report, and issued a statement to that effect after a reporter for the Moscow Times uncovered the hoax.\n\n“The report was carried out by individual employees and not the restaurant itself, which, regrettably, compromised the accuracy of this video,” Ruptly wrote.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nA spokesperson for the Kremlin, meanwhile, has only said that the government has more pressing matters to attend to, and hasn’t “gotten around to burgers yet,” per the Moscow Times.",

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and will allow the ad to run, even though the social network initially claimed it violated ad guidelines.\n\nBlackburn confirmed on Fox News' \"The Story with Martha MacCallum\" Tuesday night that Twitter will allow her ad to be promoted on the social media platform.\n\nTwitter said that they made the decision after reconsidering the \"context of the entire message,\" according to a report by Recode.\n\nBlackburn said she believes Twitter reversed its decision because \"the American people rose up.\"\n\n\"I think what has happened, the American people rose up. They are sick and tired of the liberal elites and the liberal media telling them what they're going to listen to, and what is going to be pushed forward and broadcast and what is not, and in this example it was Twitter,\" Blackburn said.\n\n\"And now they have reversed their decision after the American people have joined me in standing up to them, and they are going to allow the video to stand and us to push it forward.\"\n\nTwitter blocked an ad by Blackburn's campaign Monday, claiming it included \"an inflammatory statement that is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.\" The line in question stated: \"I'm 100% pro-life. I found Planned Parenthood, and we stopped the sale of baby body parts — thank God.\"\n\nThe social media platform initially said it would air the Senate candidate's ad, but only if the line about \"the sale of baby body parts\" was removed.\n\nMARSHA BLACKBURN DEMANDS TWITTER APOLOGIZE FOR TRYING TO 'CENSOR' PRO-LIFE AD\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Blackburn called on Twitter to apologize for blocking the advertisement, saying in a statement that she was \"appalled\" by Twitter's censorship.\n\n“I am appalled by Twitter’s attempt to censor my pro-life record, and I believe that the entire pro-life community deserves an apology and explanation for their actions,” Blackburn said in a statement. “I have spent my entire career fighting to protect and honor life, and I refuse to allow an organization whose stated mission is to ‘provide information instantly, without barriers’ the ability to silence our efforts to protect the unborn.”\n\nTwitter didn't prohibit Blackburn from promoting the ad on her own Twitter accounts, but the company wouldn't promote it as a sponsored ad on the site.\n\nBlackburn was the chair of a Republican-run House panel created to investigate Planned Parenthood and fetal tissue research. The panel urged Congress to stop federal payments to the women’s health organization.\n\nDemocrats alleged that the GOP investigation had found no wrongdoing and wasted taxpayers’ money in an abusive investigation.\n\nTWITTER DROPS GOP REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN'S AD FOR 'INFLAMMATORY' LINE ABOUT PLANNED PARENTHOOD\n\nThe panel was created after anti-abortion activists secretly recorded videos in 2015 showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing how they sometimes provide fetal tissue to researchers, which is legal if no profit is made.\n\nFetal tissue research has strong backing among scientists for its value in studying Down syndrome, eye disease and other problems. But Blackburn’s committee report said fetal tissue “makes a vanishingly small contribution to clinical and research efforts, if it contributes at all,” and recommended curbing federal grants for such research.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

                  "TEXT": "Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Baltimore Sun.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has presented his first offer on immigration reform — an exhaustive list of measures to better seal our terribly porous borders, establish internal security and reassert federal authority over renegade sanctuary cities.\n\nIt includes conservative wish list items like a wall along the Mexican border that’s too expensive and whose objectives could be better accomplished, for example, through more resources for electronic surveillance. However, the Democrats often behave as if they prefer a border with the holes of a colander to win cheap electoral advantage.\n\nSeen as a first offer to very difficult negotiating partners, Mr. Trump’s principles are best evaluated in terms of what is likely, because the Dreamers are hostage to this process, and what is needed, because the present system of granting even permanent legal visas is broken.\n\nBy endorsing the kinds of reforms proposed by Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, President Trump is offering Congress an opportunity to better consider how new arrivals can contribute to national prosperity.\n\nThe United States has about 45 million immigrants and annually welcomes 1.5 million.\n\nAbout one quarter are here illegally, and in recent years, their number has hardly changed. Declining birth rates abroad and tougher border enforcement have already slowed the inflow.\n\nCanada and Australia face challenges similar to ours — falling birth rates, skill shortages and societies defined by waves of immigrants from Europe and Asia — and both place priority on the needs of their economies.\n\nIn contrast to other industrialized countries, the United States places greater emphasis on family reunification. Green Cards are granted automatically to spouses, minor children and parents of U.S. citizens. Subject to annual limits, entry is granted to other relatives of citizens, legal immigrants and refugees, and those who can contribute to economic growth.\n\nUltimately, about 65 percent of immigrant visas are based on family ties and 15 percent on employment. The remainder is mostly through a lottery for underrepresented countries.\n\nThe Cotton-Perdue bill would limit family reunification visas to minor children and spouses, end the lottery and focus on workforce needs.\n\nPotential economic growth is determined by the sum of productivity and labor force growth. Both have fallen, causing many economists to conclude 2 percent growth is inevitable. However, missing from this is a discussion of labor force quality.\n\nInnovations in robotics, artificial intelligence and other areas indicate broad opportunities to boost productivity, but American businesses face shortages of skilled technicians and engineers to fully exploit those.\n\nCurrently, immigrant workers tend to be concentrated among two groups: those with less than a high school education and those with more than a four-year college degree.\n\nImmigrants tend to be older than the native population and more than half qualify for means-tested entitlements, creating obvious frictions.\n\nDownward pressure on wages of lower skilled workers is measurable, but overall the impact of immigration on growth is positive. Technology-intensive activities are greatly enhanced by the influx of high-skilled immigrants, and those benefits overwhelm the costs imposed by lower wages on unskilled workers.\n\nImmigration stresses social cohesion, especially among the working class. New arrivals compete for jobs and often eat different foods, practice different religions and have different family and community traditions.\n\nFolks in small towns and rural counties, riveted by the loss of factories and consolidation in agriculture, increasingly rely on those very things to cope. And they feel alienated by the ethnic diversity and libertine values of larger cities. Those are important reasons why they don’t leave for educational and employment opportunities in diverse urban settings and have abandoned the Democratic Party.\n\nLiberals in big cities — especially in the media and universities who shape public perceptions — dismiss middle-American ambivalence as ill-informed, xenophobic and racist.\n\nAfter all, the urban elite work harmoniously in Manhattan office buildings, California technology centers and the like where cultural affinities that bring together professional groups tend to overwhelm ethnic differences among highly educated adults — if nothing else, professional schools like mine socialize students to common metropolis values and behavior.\n\nWhat works for Ivy League and elite state university graduates does not rhyme well for ordinary working folks in America’s interior.\n\nThat’s why those common people elected Donald Trump to the dismay of urban intellectuals. As Barrack Obama so often lectured during his first years, elections should have consequences, and now the will of the common folks should be served.",

                  "TEXT": "There’s no better place to test drive the Dodge Challenger SRT Demon than a dragstrip. And there’s no better dragstrip than Atco Dragway in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, a muscle car hotbed and home to the legendary Jersey Devil.\n\nThat’s where I had the chance to strap into the driver’s seat and take a Demon for a dozen runs. I should say “the seat,” because it comes with only one, making it the world’s most awesome pizza delivery vehicle.\n\nAnd it can haul.\n\nThe Demon is the most powerful American car ever made. It has a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 that puts out 808 hp and still gets 22 mph on the highway. It’s an update of the Challenger SRT Hellcat’s 707 hp motor, which now seems quaint — even more so if you fit the Demon with the special engine control module, included in a tool-and-parts kit called the Demon Crate, that allows it to run on 100 octane race gas and bumps the power up to 840 hp to go with its 770 lb-ft of torque.\n\nOver half of the Hellcat engine’s components were modified in the, including the block, and a monstrous 2.7-liter supercharger strapped on to the top of it. The Demon’s 8-speed automatic transmission, driveshaft, differential and half shafts are appropriately beefed-up, as well.\n\nThere is no manual transmission available, but the automatic is one of the coolest ever made. It’s equipped with a feature called a TransBrake. It’s a drag racing technology that, in this case, engages first and second gears simultaneously to bind the transmission, so you can step on the gas to build up torque in the engine and drivetrain without having to use the brakes, which wouldn’t be able to hold back much of what the Demon dishes out before the tires started spinning. Meanwhile, a torque converter with a high stall speed lets you rev engine even higher than you normally could without moving as you await the green light.\n\nBefore we get to that, a few other notes on the Challenger’s transformation from Hellcat to Demon. With the project’s goals being a sub-10-second quarter-mile and the ability to lift the front wheels on launch, the SRT team knew it had to trim a few pounds — 232 pounds, it turns out — from the coupe’s over 2-ton weight.\n\nEliminating the passenger seat and rear bench (both can be added back in for $1 each) along with the trunk carpet and spare tire was the easy part. Swapping in some lightweight suspension parts and smaller brakes is indicative of the Demon’s drag racing focus — although it retains its computer-controlled shock absorber system and still handles pretty well for a behemoth.\n\nThe suspension plays an important role in the Demon’s straight-line speed, too. When you set the car to Drag Mode, it stiffens the rear shocks and softens the fronts to help transfer the weight to the meaty, 12.4-inch wide Nitto drag radials at launch. The result is a car that can cover a quarter mile in 9.96 seconds on premium fuel and 9.65 seconds on race gas in ideal conditions with a set of skinny “front-runner” tires installed. The Demon Crate comes with a set of rims for a pair.\n\nThe first time I gave it a shot, I skipped the TransBrake and used the traditional launch control system to get a feel for things. And oh, how it felt.\n\nYou simply press the brake pedal hard, floor the gas, release the brake and become one with the deep bucket seat. I’ve been in quick production cars before, but none prepared me for the violence the Demon took off with. The thunder coming out of the exhaust mixed with the screeching supercharger enhanced the experience in a way the silent electric motors of a ‘Ludicrous’ Tesla never could.\n\nAnd it pulled all the way down the strip, which I covered in 10.2 seconds at 134 mph. And to think that launch control neuters the car. Using the TransBrake is the way to unleash its full abilities, but you’ll need plenty of your own to go with it.\n\nTo engage it, you pull both paddles behind the steering wheel, give it some gas (but not too much) and then, when the screen on the instrument cluster tells you it’s OK, you let one paddle go and take your foot off the brake.\n\nIt’ll let you sit there like that for about 15 seconds. You release the other paddle to get moving, and then it’s all you. There’s no traction control in this mode, so you need to modulate the throttle to keep from smoking the tires. It’s easier said than done with all that power, even on a strip prepped with sticky traction compound and rubbered-in. On my first three tries, I botched it pretty good.\n\nI eventually managed to get away cleanly a couple of times, but never did better than the launch control. I’m sure a drag racing regular could.\n\nJim Wilder, the Demon’s development manager, is one of those. He took me for a run in a two-seat car with front-runners on it and pretty much all I can remember is getting walloped in the back and looking at the sky as we left the line. He may have overseen its development, but the launch control has nothing on him. I was so taken aback by the ride that I spaced out and forgot to check his time. Pride wouldn’t allow me to tell you what it was, anyway.\n\nDodge isn’t the first to hop up a Hellcat, of course. Plenty of shops have figured out how to get this much power and more out of it. The difference is that the Demon comes with a warranty. Wilder said his team did over 500 quarter-mile runs on a single axle, and more than 900 with the same transmission, and both looked like new when they pulled them out to inspect them. It’s doubtful any Demons will see that much action in the real world.\n\nThe Demon starts at $86,090. That’s a lot for a toy, and that’s exactly what it is. But it’s likely a steal at that price.\n\nDodge is building only 3,300 of them for the U.S. and Canada, and they’ve all been allocated. It did its best to keep dealers from marking them up, but some people are already trying to flip cars they don’t have yet for double what they’re paying, and a few probably will. If not now, then in a few years at one of those collector car auctions on TV.\n\nThat is, unless Dodge manages to outdo itself. When the Hellcat came out a few years ago, everyone thought it marked the end of days for the muscle car, and then they went and made the Demon and turned the Hellcat into a commodity. While it is a one-year-and-done model, the Challenger is going to be around at least until 2020, so there’s time for an even more evil encore.\n\nBut what the devil would they call it?\n\n----------\n\n2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon\n\nBase price: $86,060\n\nType: 1- to 5-passenger, 2-door, rear-wheel-drive coupe\n\nEngine: 6.2-liter supercharged V8\n\nPower: 808/840 hp, 770 lb-ft\n\nTransmission: 8-speed automatic\n\nMPG: 13 city/22 highway",

                  "TEXT": "Pizza Hut is introducing a new triple-insulated delivery pouch designed to deliver pizzas 15 degrees hotter than before.\n\nThe completely redesigned pouch, along with a new box that features thicker sides to trap heat and the pizza chain’s commitment to hire 14,000 more drivers are all aimed at giving customers the hottest pizza possible.\n\nBURGER KING'S NEW SPICY NUGGETS ARE A DIRECT ATTACK ON WENDY'S\n\n“The pizza pouch is part of our completely re-engineered ‘oven-hot delivery system,’” said Zipporah Allen, Pizza Hut vice president of brand marketing and consumer insight, told NRN on Monday. The pouch, which accommodates three boxed pizzas, was designed for a 20 to 35-minute delivery period.\n\nA post shared by Pizza Hut 🍕 (@pizzahut) on Oct 9, 2017 at 2:17pm PDT\n\nThe pouch’s three layers consist of a 3M Thinsulate lining, a heat-reflecting aluminum material and a polyester fiber padding. Each layer was meticulously thought out, drawing from materials used in cold-weather jackets, space blankets and home insulation.\n\nAlong with the updated pizza pouch, the new box comes with some fresh features of its own. In addition to the heat-trapping corrugated sides, there will be a new tray for the pizza to sit on.\n\n“In particular, the crisp sheet will go into every Pizza Hut box,” Allen said. “The role of the crisp sheet is to keep the crust crisp and craveable as the pizza is being transported from the oven the consumer.”\n\nA post shared by Pizza Hut 🍕 (@pizzahut) on Oct 10, 2017 at 12:28pm PDT\n\nThe crisp sheet is cardboard that is ridged, Allen said, “so you get the insulation from the air between the ridges.”\n\nThen comes the better algorithm to ensure more efficient drivers and more accurate delivery times, with text notifications to keep the customer updated -- making for a quick and perfectly hot pie.\n\nThese updates are part of Yum Brands’ $130 million investment plan for Pizza Hut to improve restaurant technology and equipment.\n\n“We have cracked the code on how to deliver pizzas hotter,\" Allen told CNBC. \"This is consistent with where we see our growth, with digital and delivery.\"\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nTo coincide with rolling out the new and improved delivery system, The Hut is also releasing a Pizza Parka made from the same materials used for the pouch. Customers who order online will get a chance to win the parka. Also, Twitter users can tweet @PizzaHut a pizza slice and fire emoji to enter the Pizza Parka giveaway.\n\n“The Pizza Parka is going to keep the lucky recipients hot in the same cold-weather elements that our pizzas often endure on the delivery trip from our restaurants to their front doors,” Allen said.\n\nPizza Hut is rolling out these changes in 6,300 restaurants across the nation.",
